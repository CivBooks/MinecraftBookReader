Page 0: §0Hey man!

Welcome to Muttsworld, and the region. My name's Vakura, and I live in the treehouse above you.

I just wanted to warn you that the Muttsworl rules on property lines state that the structures must be at least 40 blocks away 
Page 1: §0from another players build. I dont mind you being here, but some of the toher players who live here with me might, and they might report you. 

That being said, I do have some rooms available if you so desire. The only two things I would ask of you if yo
Page 2: §0were to accept would be that 1) you replace all that you take, replanting for every plant you farm and breeding an animal for each you kill and 2) that you dont take things from other players or their rooms. 

If you do not wish to join us, thats okay,
Page 3: §0but I'm afraid Ill have to ask you to move your house 40 blocks away so you dont get reported to the Moderators by my roomates.

Feel free to /tell me anything if you have any questions, or if I'm not around you can leave a book in my mailbox or a sign a
Page 4: §0the base of the tree.

Best of luck, and have fun!

-Vakura

Page 0: Hello 

My name is Supertuhermana / Nini and im the author of this book.

This book is about the things that i did the days i played Minecraft in Muttsworld with my friends......

September 21- 2014 
Page 1: I open my M.c at 6:30 am in the morning. I was getting clay outside my river castle when i saw that my friend "The super Willy" wrote something in the chat. I thought i was the only one that get up early to play M.c ...

He couldnt talk the first 2 hours 
Page 2: because his parents were sleeping. That was until 10:00 am.

When his parents woke up he called me through Skype and we start to talk. I accidentaly kill him... Well, not accidentaly :) 

We decided to get the achivements of M.c. I started crafting a 
Page 3: cake to get "The Lie".

After that i craft a fishing rod and i fished fish,

Finally i trapped a pig on an egg (Pokeball) and throw it off a cliff. That was fun. 

I had to go and when i came back my friend was not connectect.
Page 4: Then i dicided to go to a mine. I started to mine in a strange place and i, better if i only tell what i got? Ah ok...

I got : 1 Spider Spawner, 2 Cave Spider Spawners, 2 Stacks of Iron, 4 Cat discs, 1 Iron Horse Armor and alot more of things. Im happy

Page 0: Dear kwicky99
I will move if I have to. I tryed to get as far way for the cleared land as I could but I didn't know you would be expanding. I have three double full chest and I don't think I have time in my real life to spend to move. I am in high school 
Page 1: and have a lot of homework. I'm sorry to interupt your project but I live here. I found your land when I was exploring and moved as far as possible. As for ValforCrypt I don't know her. I saw her one day and she gave me food and followed me to my house 
Page 2: and desided we would be roomates. She had flying hacks but I forgot to report her. I doubt we can move her stuff. She never said anything in chat so she is a big problem.
Page 3: I would really like to stay here I know you were her first but you have a lot of land. I AM willing to move to the top of this mountian is that is out of the way. I could close off my door way and live in the mountian. I would move my farm to the top and 
Page 4: make my castle.

I can't do much more than that. I really hope I can get out of the way but it will be really hard. thx

   -Passive Mobs

HP - 3 Hearts
Damage - None
Spawn:

-Light level of 4-
Drops - None
EXP - 0
|LORE|
Bats are passive mobs that spawn naturaly in caverns or other large enclosed space.
Page 5: Bats are the only passive mob able to fly, And the only one that spawns in the overworld. The will often emit a squeaking noise, but do not do many other things that effect gameplay. They do not drop XP or any other items when killed, Thus making it the
Page 6: Most useless mob in the game.
|WRITER NOTE|
They aren't entirely useless. If you hear a Bat squeaking underground, it would most likely mean a cave is nearby.
Page 7: ||The Chicken|||
HP - 2 Hearts
Spawn: Opaque blocks with two blocks abovee them minimum, or a Thrown egg. (1/8 chance)
Drops:
-Feathers (0-2)
-Raw chicken (1)
-Cooked Chicken (1, Death by fire)

Page 8: -Eggs (Randomly every 5-10 Minutes while alive)
EXP - (1-3)
|LORE|
Chickens are one of the most common mobs in Minecraft, and to most players, one of the most annoying ones. They make great farming animals, due to the fact that
Page 9: They constantly produce Eggs and meat, Feathers, and EXP.
|WRITER NOTE|
Chickens can get glitched inside Fence corners, so it is best if you use blocks as a way to contain chickens, such as a 2 block deep pit with a ladder to get out.
Page 10: ||The Cow||
HP - 5 Hearts
Spawn:
-Opaque blocks with a two block space above them
Drops:
-Leather (0-2)
-Raw beef (1-3)
-Steak (1-3, Death by fire)
Milk - Right clicking with a bucket
Page 11: EXP - (1-3)
|LORE|
Cows are also one of the most common mobs in Minecraft, and are the most important to farmers. They are the easiest animal to farm, and the most efficient, if farmed correctly.
|WRITER NOTE|
Cows are also idiots. It's normal to
Page 12: see a cow wander from the herd. Cows would usualy walk around aimlessly, and tend to jump off of high cliffs, aswell as stay in water. They can be lured with wheat, but everyone knows that.
Page 13: ||The Mooshroom||
HP - Same as cow
Drops:
-Same drops as cow
-Mushroom stew (Right click with bowl)
-Red mushroom (5 upon shearing)
EXP - Same as cow
|LORE|
The Mooshroom is the mob that gives the most resources.
Page 14: However, the fact that they spawn in Rare biomes makes it difficult to find these magnificent creatures. They can be identified by looking like a cow, but with mushrooms on them. Shearing a mooshroom turns a mooshroom into a Normal cow.
|WRITER NOTE|
Page 15: Mooshrooms behave just like normal cows, Except instead of Babies following their Parents, It's the other way around. And if you were to shear a Baby mooshroom, it would no longer stay with it's parents.
Page 16: ||The Ocelot||
HP - 5 Hearts
Spawn: Jungle Biomes
Drops - None
EXP - (1-3)
|LORE|
Ocelots are the second tameable mob introduced to Minecraft. When tamed, they become cats. Cats will follow the player and teleport to them
Page 17: when the player is too far away. Creepers will run away from ocelots and cats, which makes them useful for warding off ambushes from any location.
|WRITER NOTE|
Taming a cat is a bit tricky. You can't trap ocelots in a space, Otherwise they will be 
Page 18: Untamable. You must Have a Raw fish in hand to tame one. Walk up to it slowly, And stand still, looking at the cat slowly. Don't chase after the cat, wait until it comes to you. It will sort of strafe when it approaches you.
Page 19: ||The Pig||
HP - 5 Hearts
Spawn: Any lit area with grass
Drops:
-Raw Porkchop (1-3)
-Cooked porkchop (1-3, Death by fire)
-Saddle (1, If saddled)
EXP - (1-3)
Page 20: |LORE|
Forget what i said about cows, The pigs have taken up the title of the Most common mob in Minecraft, and has held that title ever since the beta. Can be bred with Carrots on the PC, Wheat on the XBox. They are the only passive mob to be 
Page 21: Ridable and not tamed, Other than horses.
|WRITER NOTE|
Fly High! Ever since 1.4, We have been able to ride Pigs off cliffs much more effectively!

My first night here -- I'm dismayed that I wasn't supplied with a bed, but am thankful that I did get a house. I buried my daughter tonight, too. I hope in time I will earn my pride back from that... mistake.
Page 1: Day 2

First day on the job, and my Master, Tandiman, has put me to work with farming -- which was fairly easy. I hope that all the jobs I must do are like this.
Page 2: Day 3

I finally got my first payday, along with finding enough wool to make my bed -- the job is coming along well, and everything is running well within my system.
Page 3: Day 4

The tree farm that I started on Day 2 has begun to grow. I was suttly reminded of my daughter, as she reminded me of the beauty of a new sapling. Another hard day of work. Finding resources is not easy.
Page 4: Day 5

Productivity! That's what my dad always said, and it is a word I've always lived by. If I'm going to work a job, I'm going to do it well.
Page 5: Day 6

I've begun a project where I need to expand the farms. Finally, a project I can set my mind to. I am assured that I will do the job well.

Page 6: Day 14

The Farm Expansion Project is finally finished... Although I haven't had a payday in a long time.

I've been gone a good long while, took a trip up North back to the old house we used to stay in on the mountain. I'm back now, so I expect hard work will be given to me.

	Title: Zapdos
	Author: Sainono
	Type: Written

Page 0: Lightning 1:1: Among the ruins of the now Kanto region, nothing had been created. It was a baren wastland, and nothing was forsot. Nothing... but a pidgey. The last ever remain of the B.R. (Before Red) apocalypse. It was hungry, hungry for whatever food 
Page 1: there was left. It didn't apear to this Pidgey, that the skys had grown dark, a final storm cloud, and the final bolt of lightning... for the creator of the Universe. The Lightning Bolt struck the Pidgey, and it grew ten fold... into the mighty Zapdos.
Page 2: Benevolence 1:1: Zapdos sat there, having a new power to bring out to the world. §0
§0"What must i create?" Said Zapdos, but the answer... was already clear. Zapdos flew high above, and with one mighty wish of his powerful wings, he created a skitty.
Page 3: Power 2132:5: Now that the world was completely covered with the divine cat, Zapdos decided to create more. A cat needed someone to care for it. With one incredible caw from its beek, Zapdos created a person, who shall be forever known as (looks up latin
Page 4: stem) Bon Trevicus, the leader of the cats. But one human wasn't enough, no, he created a second person... (looks up stem again) named Boi Jesimus. Soon, Zapdos created thousands of humans, and the world was ruled by cats and humans alike. 
Page 5: Molten 99:66: Zapdos wasn't alone though, another Pidgey was born from the Mt. Chimney, and arose... the horrifying Moltres. He looked at the power of Zapdos, and became jealous, so he created the dog.
Page 6: Fracturilias 7:7: Moltres took his giant army of ruthless dogs, and headed straight to the Kanto lands of Zapdos, and soon a giant war began. Left and right kittens were being massacred, Moltres at the head, killing all and anyone who questioned his will.
Page 7: Bambama in da Bum 11:
Zapdos didn't know what to do, and he felt alone. Then Bon Trevicus and Boi Jessimus came to him for counsil.

"Sire, you must defend us in anyway possible" They said. Of course Zapdos wanted to do this, but how.
Page 8: Ice 8008: HAH: 
Zapdos now knew what to do. And so, he wazed both wings, and there apeared... Articuno. Articuno was least wise and could not create things, but he had the power to take Moltres out.
Page 9: Retaliation 5555:6666:
So Articuno and Zapdos went straight to Moltres. On his throne Moltres was laughing, he had gone mad over his power. Immediatly Moltres cassed out a waze of fire that destroyed the sourounding land. But he did not no the justfull 
Page 10: power of Articuno. Moltres was knocked down, but it was not enough, he sent a blaze of fire, instantly burning Articuno. The Icy Ash's flew away, to return later. 

"WELL, WATCHU GONNA DOOOOOO!" said the insane Moltres. Zapdos didn't know.
Page 11: "WELL, YUH GUNNAH DO NUTTIN YAH LITTLE BEIRRRRRD" said Moltres. And then, Zapdos knew what to do.
Page 12: POKEMON! Yes:Yes:
Zapdos grabbed Moltres.

"I will make you mortal"

"BUT DEN YOU GUNNA MAK YO SELF MORTAL TOOOOOOOOO" 

"I know" Zapdos spread his wings, and let his and Moltres power go.
Page 13: This marked the end of the war, the end of the Cat-Human rulling, but it did create somethign far greater. With Moltres lost power, thousands of animals were created, animals now known as Pokemon. A few of these animals held Zapdoses glory, but there were
Page 14: never more than one of these kind. Moltres was created to be completely mad, but he  had nothing to do about it. Articuno was recreated, mortal, but powerful. And Lastly Zapdos, he lost mortality, but he could still speak, and with those words, he spread 
Page 15: the words of Benevolence.
Page 16: Ash Heh: Topkek:
Ash was created from the ashes of Articuno. Hes really dumb. MOVING ON.
Page 17: Ash Do: It:
No, really, he like, didn't want to evolve his Pikachu into a much more powerful and awesome Raichu. Also, he kinda sucks at keeping promises. MOVING ON.
Page 18: Ash Comon:Anything;
SERIOUSLY, he dosn't even age, its like: DUTUTUTUTU IM TWENTY YEARS OLD, IMA CHILE LAV MEH. Its soooo stupid. MOVING ON.
Page 19: Ash I:Got:Bored:
Well, we move to the less boring part of the story after this, Red. Ash's older and much smarter brother. But APERANTLY, our publishers think the part with the cats and that shiz was too impractical, DO I LOOK LIKE I KNOW WHAT IM DOING, 
Page 20: the Church of Zapdos was all like: HAY MAKE OUR BOOK, and I was all like, WHY, and they were all like, WE'LL PAY YAH, and I was like, OKAY. But yah, the publishers think IM impractical, so Im not gunna be serious for this Ash part, in fact Im going to 
Page 21: parafraise the whole RED part, so, lets get to it. MOVING. ON.
Page 22: Red Yah:Yah;Yah:
So um Red was all like, GIMMEH DAT SQUIRTLE, and Proffeser Oak was all like, OKAH. So Red goes around and all the Gym's are being destroyed, and finnaly, he's at this Power Plant, and Zapdos is there, and its all like, OH MY GOD, ITS GOD.
Page 23: And Zapdos was like: O Use your Masterball Luke, I mean Doctor, I mean Frodo, I mean Bilbo, I mean Harry, I mean Katnis, I mean Neo, I MEAN RED (puff puff puff) and Red was all like, OKAY, and then there a horse and hes all like, I LOVE IT. And yah stuff 
Page 24: like that, AND HAY 25th page, I SAY ITS TIME TO PUBLISH THIS BOOK DONT YOU, LETS DO IT.

it all started at that moment in time. When minecrafters looked at thier clocks and saw the sun set as the moon rised, Time all at once stopped dead in its tracks in the middle of the Night.Terror

INSPIRED BY THE CRUSHES OF HER PAST

Page 1: REVIEWS:

Still a better love story than twilight - Everyone

5/5 Would Finger to again - 80% of lesbians

Muttsworld Lesbian Erotica 2013 Award
Page 2: Audrey was a tall, long-haired brunette with brown eyes and the face of a goddess. She was everyone's dream. Unfortunately for the male population this woman was blessed with the curse of being a lesbian. Countless men and women were dumbstruck by her
Page 3: looks. The dominate, aggressive, Audrey had no preference for men. She enjoyed taking submissive women and turning them into her playtoys for the evening.

Audrey went to a coffee shop to get coffee. What the hell else would she get at
Page 4: a coffee shop? Condoms? NO. However, there was this cute girl named Sofia. She had a soft-round cute face. One you could fuck all night to.

Now that we have the two main characters in the scene. Let's get to the hot and sexy part. The shower....
Page 5: LLOOL JK WHO HAS SEX IN A SHOWER.

So, the two warmed things up nice and sweet with a shower. Some cute cuddling standing up and fondling tits and washing each other. As they are about to get dirty so I don't know why they didn't save
Page 6: the shower until after. Audrey gets tired after sex don't judge her.

Sofia lays down naked on the bed and Audrey is not slow to lay ontop of Sofia's wet naked body. Sofia and Audrey were both athletes so they had nice hot bodies.
Page 7: Hot too look at, not hot to touch atleast not until they started to fuck.

Things got hot.

The bed sheets melted.

The house caught on fire.

No bodies could be
Page 8: found in the charred remains of their hot, steamy, sexy, sex.

LOL JK that would be horrible. SO let's focus back onto the bed.

Now, I'm sure we all know what happens when to lovely lesbians get together
Page 9: in a bed. So, i'll spare you the details.

I'm sure your head can do the rest of the work. Add some strapons or only use one. Or two. Ten. Kinky shit man. Not litterally. 

The End.

Page 0: Have you ever heard of Jurassic World? It is an AWESOME place in a island! But you might be wondering why it is called Jurassic World! Its very simple! It is a park that has dinosaurs dinosaurs and more DINOSAURS!!!! There are dinosaurs such as T rexs,
Page 1: Stegasaurus', Mososaurus', and more!!! There are shops and pens for each type of dinosaurs! Every hour there is a show that contains the Sea Reptiles! These are reptiles that are in the sea but not really dinosaurs since they swim!
Page 2: If you want to explore the world of Jurassic World and get super close to your favorite dinosaurs you can go to the hamster balls!!! Dont worry about getting hurt or killed by the meat eaters because they can not break it! No Siree!!
Page 3: If you are small enough you could be able to ride on baby dinosaurs!! Such as the Tricaritops!!! If you want to be in a place that is like a dinosaur display go to the visitor center!!! The visitor center shows fossils and fake dinosaurs even better you
Page 4: can dig for dinosaurs! If there is ever an a escape dinosaur hide your cent then take cover! If you are getting chased by a dinosaur RUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN!
Page 5: If you ever want to come here and not take forever on a boat do /warp Jurrasic                   It might be miss spelled because of THEORY but dont worry it doesent change your dinosaur experiance!!!! So come on any join the fun and remember... Have Fun!

Livestock

Step 1
Starting your farm
Build a pen , large enough for your animals , but small enough to keep them organized 
Page 1: Step 2 
Animal Selection
Certain animals give certain things. Cows give leather steak and milk , As do mooshrooms . Pigs only give porkchops , Chickens give eggs , feathers , and raw chicken . Sheep give wool , shearable with shears .      >
Page 2: Step 3
Spawn Eggs
Start your farm with spawn eggs and/or gather farm animals near you. Spawn eggs are the easiest way to start your livestock farm . It will cost you but its easy to make up the cost

>
Page 3: Step 4
Breeding
Chickens  >Seeds
Pigs > Carrots
Cows > Wheat
Sheep > Wheat
Mooshroom > Wheat

it takes 3-5 minecraft days to grow up fully
Page 4: Step 5
Protection
Griefers love to kill animals . Protect them with enclosed pens and land protection . They cant kill what they cant reach
Keep in mind , animals despawn . So harvest or slaughter quickly

>
Page 5: Step 6
Pokeballs
Mutts uses a plugin that allows you to gather animals with less than half health . just throw an egg at them when they are below half . Always save 2 spawn eggs to restart your farms

Page 4:      Introduction§0
§0=================== Welcome to potion brewing! If you're new, keep in mind that you need a brewing stand, glass bottles filled with water, and many ingredients, which vary depending on what type of potion you may want to create.
Page 5:      Introduction§0
§0=================== Every brewing stand has the capability to hold at maximum three bottles at a time, meaning you can make 3 potions for every single ingredient you add. Keep this in mind!
Page 6:   Base Ingredients§0
§0=================== These ingredients start all potions.§0
§0------------------- ?Nether Wart§0
§0?Glowstone Dust§0
§0?Redstone§0
§0?Fermented Spider Eye [Adding these to a water bottle will create a base potion. see page 11]

§0?Ghast Tear§0

§0?Fermented Spider Eye§0
§0[See next page]
Page 9:   Effect Corruption§0
§0=================== Fermented Spider Eyes will change a potion's base effect, often reversing it or producing a negative potion. A "corrupted" potion usually does the opposite of the original potion.
Page 10:       Base Potions§0
§0=================== Base potions, much like base ingredients, are the basis of all potions. These are the potions created by simply a watter bottle and a base ingredient together.

Page 1: The problem is that we don't have owners for each of the stalls. We would be eternally grateful if you would be the owner of 'Yum Yum Food'. Thanks just leave a sign at my trade shop with your awnser. Thanks§0

Page 4:      Introduction§0
§0=================== Welcome to potion brewing! If you're new, keep in mind that you need a brewing stand, glass bottles filled with water, and many ingredients, which vary depending on what type of potion you may want to create.
Page 5:      Introduction§0
§0=================== Every brewing stand has the capability to hold at maximum three bottles at a time, meaning you can make 3 potions for every single ingredient you add. Keep this in mind!
Page 6:   Base Ingredients§0
§0=================== These ingredients start all potions.§0
§0------------------- ?Nether Wart§0
§0?Glowstone Dust§0
§0?Redstone§0
§0?Fermented Spider Eye [Adding these to a water bottle will create a base potion. see page 11]
Page 7: Secondary Ingredients =================== ?Magma Creme§0
§0?Sugar§0
§0?Glistering Melon§0
§0?Spider Eye§0
§0?Ghast Tear§0
§0?Blaze Powder§0

§0?Fermented Spider Eye§0
§0[See next page]
Page 9:   Effect Corruption§0
§0=================== Fermented Spider Eyes will change a potion's base effect, often reversing it or producing a negative potion. A "corrupted" potion usually does the opposite of the original potion.
Page 10:       Base Potions§0
§0=================== Base potions, much like base ingredients, are the basis of all potions. These are the potions created by simply a watter bottle and a base ingredient together.

Page 0: Mining In My Dreamland


I was awoken in a home... I coudnt remember how I got to this house but I did know that the last thing I saw was a face. I walked around the house confused and scared. I see footprints I never 
Page 1: seen before. I followed them to see if it was a person or thing that can help me. It stopped in a unusual cave. Words cant describe how weird it was. It was blue and purple light thingies coming out and weird looking structures that made me freak out in a
Page 2: second. I was confused. I stepped further in and I fell in a hole that scared me for life! In a flash, I saw blood. In the second flash, I saw the wonderland and I stayed on that flash. I looked around my surroundings.... Couldn't find anything..... But I
Page 3: did see a bright light. I felt like that light was my friend. It was dark where I was and it felt like I was floating in mid-air. The light waved its little hands and softly said "Flecha" I didn't know what it said but the little friends sounded like it 
Page 4: wanted me to follow it. The more I followed it, the deeper and colder I went. Darkness was my enemy because thats all I saw, but the light from moving light made it brighter than the sun. I called the moving light Flecha because it was obssesed with the 
Page 5: word. Flecha stopped and disapeared! I looked around worried. My life is coming to a end. I felt a hand on my leg. I jumped, scream, and kicked. It felt like a dead boney hand. Oh how terrified.
Page 6:     Chapter 2: Lets go somewhere exciting...

The skeletal hand pulled me into a pit of darkness. After 10 seconds, lights went on. I saw pictures all over the place, and under all of them, it said '' My Beloved Gypsy Zarea '' I stared at the picture
Page 7: long and hard just enough to see that ''Gypsy'' looked like me... Confused enough that I asked out loud '' Where am I??! '' 
 No one answered. Really awkward and random but I was desprete to know.

Page 0:        Sammich's
      Muttsworld
         Story



by Sammich98
Page 1:    Once upon a time,
there was a beautiful princess named Sammich. She was only a beautiful princess because her skin was Princess Daisy.
  She had discovered Muttsworld after some time of single player minecraft and played for a while in solitude and 
Page 2: silence. At some point, she got a boyfriend by the name of "mrawesome12345" or something of the likes. Then, after Minecraft dating him for a while he got banned, because his "brother" griefed. She still visited his house at /spawn 4 until it was no 
Page 3: longer a command and she was too lazy to walk from there. Sometime between then and now, she got active in the chat and was very helpful to the many, many noobs of Muttsworld. It was about 5 or 6 months of playing, and she made a staff application to be 
Page 4: an ambassador. That was when only mods and admins could reply to applications and anyone could reply to ban appeals. Sammich got quite positive feedback on the app, with +0.5s and +1s.
  Then.... after a month of the application being there with
Page 5: nothing but positive reviews, she logged on to Muttsworld and a friend said something to her in chat.
"huh?" was about what her reply was.
Then, the realization sunk in. She was an ambassador.



Page 6: Skip forward to April 2013, where she didn't play Minecraft for a month or so and got demoted. She basically didn't play much for a while, until the fall of 2013, when she got re-promoted to ambassador. So then, she played Muttsworld lots and lots
Page 7: as an ambassador, until one day...

Mumblerit needed a shower, but no mods were on to handle modreqs.
"who wants to be a mod?" he had asked
A cry of "me!" was seen in diplochat.
Page 8: "lol" was all the beautiful Princess Sammich said.
"ah, sammich. perfect" was about what mumblerit had said.
So, she was a mod.
  Then, that brings us to where we are now (well, where Sammich is now as she is writing this), which is Sammich floating
Page 9: in the sky at /spawn.


THE END

Chaos Flatlands:
What to our knowlegde is the center of the earth, and the birth place of civilization is the Chaos Flatlands. These bountiful flatlands were once ruled by nature, and boosted a number of animals. Now humans rule this land.
Page 1: Because of the resources in the Chaos Flatlands, they are highly valued, and highly populated. Many have settled there to live off of its many resources. The flatlands are large, and can support this large population. However all is not peaceful in the 
Page 2: flatlands, as is its name sake. Competition for land and resources his very common here. Wars, and political turmoil often occur. More often then not, the sword is used more then the mouth to end disputes. The rulers of the Chaos Flatlands rule, and fall.
Page 3: It is just apart of life.

In the Chaos Flatlands are infact a number of towns. The two most prominante are Wolf Den, and Greensburg. Both of them sit before the Greensburg Chasm. Both these cities are sometimes known as the sister cities.
Page 4: Wolf Den is surrounded by tall cobblestone walls. It has large streets, and in its center is a townhall from were governance happens. Greensburg is on top of a mountain next to a large chasm. The city has tall buildings, and is run by a single mayor.
Page 5: Both cities are rivals, and compete for land and resources, from time to time. However these towns represent civilization, and they are the heart of trade, and finance in the world.

The people of the Chaos Flatlands, are known as Heartlanders
Page 6: because they are from the heart of the world, and humanity. These people live in many different cities, and settlements. Most people in the world are heartlanders. Currently most Heartlanders live in lonely settlements, but some have moved into towns.
Page 7: As for resources Chaos Flatlands, is covered in them. Good mining, and good farm land can be found here. Trees grows enough for the population to survive, but they are not in a large number. Farming is the best sources of income for the Chaos Flatlands,
Page 8: because of the long strech of rolling hills, but the flatlands are reletivally flat. Still though Mining is also a big income. Resources are what drive many conflicts in this region. 
Axe Peninsula:
The Axe Peninsula is another hot spot for resources, but
Page 9: not mining. It has no valuable ores beneath its surface, but it does have sprawling forests. The peninusla is attached to the Chaos Flatlands, and the peninsula is long, but not very wide. It has lots of wood however, spruce wood. The forest is the second
Page 10: largest discovered so far. From this the people build axes. Axes are highly valued on the peninsula, and are the main weapon used by many. 

The people of Axe Peninsula have one leader. A prince who rules from Axe point, which is a city at the very end of
Page 11: the peninsula. The city is surroned by huge thick walls. The city has city water come into the city to fill up lakes and canals. Inside the city is the castle which is huge. The castle great hall has large stained glass windows, shining chandelers, and
Page 12: the longest table known. Each room in the castle has its own fire place. Sometimes the prince will stay at his mansion known as prince mansion which is even more luxurios. The mansion overlooks the beach in the spruce forests. The people of the Axe
Page 13: Peninsula are called Westlanders because they exist as far west, as anything has ever been discovered. The people make many axes, and take spruce wood. The eastern half of the peninsula, is covered in spruce wood forsts, and the western half is a snowy
Page 14: tundra.

The people tend to stay out of problems else where in the world, but sometimes they have been known to get involved. Still though, the prince is a wealthy man, and usually isn't bothered by the petty conflicts in the Chaos Flatlands.

Page 1: §0I Pass Out At a Party

Mom was ecstatic.

"My little Jaxson's growing up"she sobbed as i hung bright blue streamers from our apartment ceiling."Mom its just a party" i replied smiling "Dont worry."
Mom sighed "Ok baby but first, What do you
Page 2: §0do if there are monsters?"I sighed,this was getting annoying."i get everyone to Camp and contact Chiron"I said for the millionth time.
"Good,have fun baby"she said as she shut the door behind her.
After all the preparations had been
set,i waited anxiousl
Page 3: §0for my friends.The door rang and i wiped my sweaty palms on my jeans.Emma came through the door first,pecking me on the cheek as she went by.I blushed.Then Katie came,then Nathan,and the last one to caome in was Jason.
"Ok everybody,"I began,turning to
Page 4: §0the mob of demigods before me.Suddenly our apartment seemed really small."I just wanted to say that-"
"No need to give us the whole monologue Kelp Head,"Emma rolled her eyes,"Were all just happy to get out of Camp for a little while."
LETS GET THIS PARTY
Page 5: §0STARTED!"Katie yelled before running over to our stereo to crank up some hevay metal rock music.
"OH NO WAY ARE WE LISTENING TO THIS!"yelled Emma,stomping over to Katie."KATY PERRY ALL THE WAY!"
I decided not to ponder Emma's song choice,and looked at 
Page 6: §0the scene around me.The party was going well.Nathan and Jason stood in a corner talking to a dead ghost that Nathan had conjured who looked suspiciously like Abraham Lincon.Emma
sat at a table cheerfully blabbing to Katie about a ancient monument in Egyp
Page 7: §0while she stared at me looking like she was dying.Then the doorbell rang for pizzas.I paid the gangly,acne coverd the delivery man and slammed the door in his face before he could finish saying,"Hey is that Abraham Linc-"


Page 8: §0Then all at once,I felt sick.

My head pounded and the world swirled around me in multi-colored hues.I dropped the pizza in suprise.
"Jaxson are you alright?"Emma asked sounding worried.
"Yeah, I just need a glass of water,"I 
Page 9: §0slurred before the ground spun up to meet me.
I blinked my eyes drearily on the floor,and saw blurred faces above me.The last thing I think before i descended into darkness was Emma's warm hands urgently shaking my shoulders.
Page 10: §0Hope you like it tell me if you did cause there is more.I didnt do anymore cause i didnt know if you liked it or not.

Page 0: §0         Sadness
Down in the blues,
For many depressing clues,
No heart may be sewed.
In the midst of the tears,
When about to break from the fears,
When pain is hardest it continues to sear.
A wailing soul can not sleep,

Page 1: §0Not a word of comfort cuts in deep,
For in this trance nothing will peep.
In your subconscious,
You are welcomed in pain and blindness,
As what has happened to you is no blissful kiss,
Nothing more but the throbbing ache of sadness.

Conscious fades,
As you cascade,
In the shade,
Only to find a fantasy made.
Your mind wanders,
Your thoughts squandered,
It ripples into seas of lavender.
At the seams,
Lights a beam,

Your consciousness teems,
Waking up you know it was just a dream.

The feel sends up a chill,
I am here to experience the thrill,
With all my strength and will,
I climb through the window sill.
The moon in the air,
No one lives up there,
The stars glitter as if they care,
It is almost too much 
Page 1: §0too bear,
In its peace I have left the bright lair,
Where no one else here will dare.
The moon and stars are a wondrous sight,
However here lingers an icy bite,
All those who follow the light,
Better go now,
Before it strikes midnight!

During his birth,
Gifts of gold, incense, myrrh,
Yet he is more than its worth.
With water he was cleansed,
In his name we are redeemed.
Twelve followers,
With Jesus' they sprout into flowers,
For Jesus'

Satan's tempt,
Was a failing attempt.
A follower's betrayal,
Then came the nails.
Nail into his hands and feet,
In his stripes we are healed,
Cleansed of our sins when his blood was revealed,
Upon the cross all believed his fate was
Page 2: §0real,
His resurrection surreal.
If you follow the sound of Satan's bell,
For eternity you shall live in torment and hell.
Follow the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be saved,
For eternity in heaven you shall remain.

adding sugar to your awkward potion makes it a swiftness potion. adding a pufferfish to your potion makes it an underwater breathing potion.
Page 2: that will come in need if you make it long. adding a glistening melon to your potion makes it a potion of healing. a fermented spider eye makes a potion of weakness. blaze powder makes a potion of strength. a ghast tear makes
Page 3: a potion of health.
a magma cream makes a fire resistant potion. spider eyes make a potion of poison.

the real brew.

how to make a brewing stand:
put one blaze rod in the center of 
Page 4: the crafting table.
then put 3 pieces of cobblestone along the bottom.
ALWAYS USE A GLASS BOTTLE FILLED WITH WATER OR YOUR DREAM POTION WILL NEVER HAPPEN.

Page 0: you probably heard of my first book, alchemy info. this is more of a sequel than another book. this shows the most efficant potions and the best to save your life. the potions will be underwater breathing, fire 
Page 1: resistance, night vision, and invisibility.

brewing your potions.

first for the underwater breathing potion you are going to need 1 pufferfish.
of course along
Page 2: with 1 nether wart. for the fire resistance, you are going to need 1 magma cream.

a little bit more complicated.

for these two potions (night vision & invisibly you will need a

you can use dust a powders in alchemy. they all stand for diffrent meanings.

sugar:swiftness
gunpowder:splash potion.

increases abitlity,
but decreases time of potion.

redstone dust: increases time,
but lowers ability.

BE CAREFUL. IF YOU PUT IN THE WRONG DUST YOU WON'T GET WHAT YOU WANTED.

Page 0: once upon a time,

there were 4 teenage guys who were just talking outside there house. then they heard a strange noise. they turned around and found a nether portal. the boys got curious and went in one by
Page 1: one.

the new world.

"whoa, what is this place." said andy.
"I think this is minecraft" explained mike." i mean, look at us. we are so.... blocky."
"my head hurts now" complained 
Page 2: bobby.
"will you please stop complaining all of you!" yelled out dan.

1 hour later....

the boys were sitting on the ground. suddenly the boys saw bobby? eating a coookie.
Page 3: "were did you get that!" yelled mike.
bobby pointed to the village in the distance. "why didnt you tell us!"said mike.

the village.

the boys were walking in the village when they 
Page 4: came upon a villager.
"welcome."said the villager."what brings you to this stupid annoying, unecessary village."
"um, we came from reality and we need to go back."said andy."do you know how?".........................
Page 5: "would you like to buy something."said the villager.
"no, we just want to get back."explained andy.......
i can trade you a block of dirt for an emerald."said the villager.
"whatever, said mike. the boys kept on walking and 
Page 6: then found the original minecraft steve guy.
"hey!"all the boys said together.
the steve guy looked around and saw the 4 dudes."huh. i thought i was playing on a single-player server." said 
Page 7: steve. 
"well, you are supposed to."said dan."we came from-"
"reality?"said steve.
"yeah and we need to get back."explained mike.
"alright then lets head to my place.
Page 8: 
adventure time.

the boys arrived at steve's house.
"its not the best."said steve."but it gets the job done."
steve looked around the bookshelves and found a book.
Page 9: "aha!"steve said.
"it says here that we need 14 blocks of obsidian."
"lets get to it then."said bobby.
steve gave andy a wooden hoe and a leather helmet. steve then gave mike an iron picaxe and a leather helmet and tunic. 
Page 10: he gave bobby some leather boots and a bow and arrow. he lastly gave dan a wooden sword and a leather tunic.

after ten minutes of endless walking they found a cavern and decided to go in it. while they were walking,
Page 11: they came across a dark, deep revine. they found a cobblestone bridge. "somebody seems to have been here before"said mike. then the boys came across 2 zombies! steve immediatly fought them and killed them like a ninga. "wow."
Page 12: said bobby amazed.

Diamonds!

the boys came across a lava puddle. but the path there was very dark. they needed torches."look! coal!" said dan.mike went to mine the coal. "i have some
Page 13: sticks."said steve."we can make some torches." mike gave him the coal and steve made torches. the began walking towards the lava puddle. "LAVA!"said dan. he immediatly went runnung and didn't realize there was a deep dark crack.
Page 14: "help!"said dan holding on the a rock. "i'm gonna die!!!!!!!!"
"here."said andy.
"use my hoe."
he gave the hoe to dan and climed up. steve then made a path of cobblestone. they reached the lava puddle when they 
Page 15: heard 2 zombies and a skeleton. mike jumped over their heads popping out of the lava and mined the diamonds. he gave the diamons to steve and made a diamond picaxe. dan poured water onto the lava. steve was mining the obsidian as the 4 
Page 16: boys fought off a buch of monsters.
steve then made the portal and lit it up. the 3 boys jumped in. mike was left to go in....."thanks" he said. steve nodded his head as mike jumped into the portal.

§0I have also provided you with a full set of armour, a sword, pickaxe, axe and bow!

Page 4: - If you are nearby anybody on the server and are talking to eachother, please use /Ch L (Chat Local)§0
§0
§0- There is a chat called serverwide that displays your message throughout all servers, we mostly use it to display funny messages to other
Page 5: servers :)§0
§0
§0- Then there is Global, (/ch g) where we basically just talk to anyone on the survival server! We can have lots of chats, with whoever we wish :)§0

Page 6: There's a plugin that we have called /friends. It's not working all the time at the moment, but it's pretty useful! You can /f add [name of player] to be notified whenever they come online! You can also talk to them through /f msg [name] or broadcast a 
Page 7: message to all your friends by using /f bmsg [message] ! §0
§0
§0There are other rules about griefing (breaking/stealing other players stuff) all I can say is, don't do it. It can get you in a lot of trouble.§0

§0
§0   So you want to be an adventurer. It's a noble profession, filled with riches and fueled by wanderlust.§0
§0As an adventurer you will see the most beautiful sights and find the deepest hidden tresures. Aswell as face the  
Page 4: most terrifying monsters and traverse the deadliest landscapes. You'll do all of this in the name of discovery, or maybe you have another reason. Whatever your reason, know that buying this book is the best decision you've ever made. Wealth awaits you 
Page 5: even in the darkest of places. Dungeons, temples, cities, towns, even the end has hidden treasure, waiting to be revealed. Do you think you have the guts to perform these heroic tasks? Then be my quest to read on and see the secrets to adventure!
Page 6:        Chapter One§0
§0The first step to becoming an adventurer is having the need items to continue your adventure. Weapons, tools, food, and verious blocks. Prefered cobblestone. Half the time you will want a crafting table at the ready. A sword and pic
Page 7: are the mainly needed items of choice. Which also leads into the next chapter!
Page 8:        Chapter Two§0
§0You need to have the skills of combat! Whether you think you do or not, mysterious beasts are not the only problem you suffer from! Other adventurers have devoted themselves to becoming looters and cheats. So you must learn to 
Page 9: defend yourself from the dangers of the wild and of society. You will need a sword and most likely a bow and arrow. If you truly wish to be safe, grab a shield to defend yourself from the many dangers that may appear. Skeletons may be one of the more
Page 10: deadly beats you will encounter. Be ready with training.
Page 11: Chapter Three§0
§0Food is a need in the wilderness. AidenTheCrusher scavenged more for food and me found a plump little boot he could eat. it had markings of Athlete's foot, sweat, and horse crap. lets not ask him why he ate it due to the third detail.

Page 0: Ok, so hears the situation. I wanted to move out of that little shack, and needed a place to build. I pondered on it for a while and came to the conclusion that, i had absolutaly, no where.
The all of a sudden, BRAINSTORM, so i began digging into that
Page 1: hill, and was going to make a dug out bunker kinda house (I do that alot) but then ran into some space issues, so i dug some more, and gave up.

 I came back later that day and had an idea to dig up the entire hill, which in turn was more difficult than I
Page 2: had expected. I used three diamond shovels, half of my good pick which has unbreaking 3 on it and i gained, WAY, to much dirt. So i stuck most of it in the chest at the village center. So if you need dirt, I am your guy, Wildsambo, dirt dealer,

Page 3: wildsambo local dirtbag, wildsambo's buckets of dirt...

Anywho, I came to you because I cut before I measured and forgot to take down the trees. And they are going to be a pain in the ass, so I will start on them, so can you finish them
Page 4: please. Thank you, and as always, I am forever greatful...

§0=================== §0
§0An incredibly basic book for learning simple German phrases. §0

Page 1: 
§0   §3§lINTRODUCTION§0
§0===================Welcome, reader! In this book, we will be discussing very basic German conversational skills. Please note: This book will §cNOT §0Fully teach you German.
Page 2: §3§l    NON-ENGLISH§0
§3§l      LETTERS§0
§0=================== If you're going to learn German, even basic phrases, there are 4 special characters you have to be aware of. 3 of them are what we call Umlaute. Umlaute are either an A, O, or U with 2 dots.
Page 3: §3ä§0: This character sounds very close to pronouncing the English letter A in the alphabet. (§aAYY§0), although it has less of a twang to it. Instead of pronouncing with a Y sound on the end, try saying "eh?"
Page 4: §3ü§0: With the U umlaut, things get more difficult. Try making an E sound, as in the word §6Me§0. While making this continued EE sound, curve your lips dramatically, like you're kissing someone or making an U sound. 
Page 5: §3ö§0: Like the U umlaut, combine the U sound with an English A. As in the word §6bay§0. While making this A sound, curve your lips, the sound produced should be a U umlaut.§0
§cPlease use Google for this part, it's very difficult to describe on-paper.
Page 6: §3ß§0: This is an Eszet. Make sure not to mistake it for a B, as it's pronounced nothing like it. The eszet is basically a short way to write a double s in German.§0
§0Example:§0
§6Füßen§0, a short way to write §6Füssen§0. §0
§0(§6Feet§0, in English.)
Page 7: A few other things to note about pronounciation of German letters:§0
§0===================§6W§0: Pronounced exactly like an English V.§0
§6V§0: Pronounced exactly like an English F.§0
§6J§0: Pronounced like an English Y. Example:§0
§0Ja = Yah.
Page 8: §6R§0: Google this one, too. It's pronounced very much like a French R, a gutteral sound from the back of your throat.§0
§6Z§0: Pronounced like an English TS. As in Pan§6ts§0. For example, Zehn (ten) is pronounced like Tsayn.
Page 9: Just like in English, groups of letters will make certain sounds together.§0
§6sch§0: Pronounced exactly like an English SH. Example: Tschüss!§0
§0would be pronounced like tshooss. (It's similar to saying Cheers! to a friend.)
Page 10: §6eu§0: Pronounced like an English -oy, as in the word b§6oy§0.§0
§6äu§0: Exactly like the EU, it is pronounced like -oy.§0
§6ie§0: Pronounced like an English ee, as in B§6ee§0.§0
§6ei§0: Pronounced like the English letter I, as in NEIN!
Page 11: §6-ch§0: The infamous flem, like you're coughing up a hairball. I'd recommend Googling this one, too.§0
§6-r§0: When an R comes at the end of a word, like a British accent, it is not pronounced. Example: Besser is pronounced like Bessah.
Page 12: §cth§0: This one is in red because it is NOT pronounced in German like in English. There is not a TH sound (like in the) in German. A TH together is simply pronounced like a T.
Page 13: Keep in mind that silent letters are almost nonexistant in German! Often you will find E's on the end of words, these are pronounced like (uh), like you're thinking about something. (uhhhh)§0
§0Example: Bitte is pronounced bit-tuh
Page 14: Now, on to what you came here for! Phrase-learning!§0

§0These are very simple phrases, that if practiced enough, could come in handy when travelling.

Page 0: Dear Diary, 
I gets more disturbing every day seeing the ruins griefing have left on the mutts survival server. Torn up houses, abused animals and broken builds. Sometimes I wonder about the nerve of some people. You call them griefers I call them Idiots.
Page 1: Dear Diary,
My new friend Bullsye
helped me as a noob I am very thankful, he says I am a natural mutts adventurer. We are going to strike diamonds and destroy the griefers of this server.
Page 2: Dear Diary, 
Today bullsye and I went advenuring and we foal with a white muzzle I picked it up in the pelting rain. Bullsye had hardened over time because of the griefers but he at least had a little simpathy left we took it with us, we journeyed on.
Page 3: Dear Diary,
It has been a while four years bullsye and I are still great friends we named
the foal Lucy, She is grown up now and she is living with Bull. He is setting off tomorrow to map out the server riding lucy. I wish him luck.
Page 4: Dear Diary,
Bull has returned with nine hand written rice paper maps I helped him hang them up in the town square. However I did not dare to mention how our quest for diamonds went unfinished...
Page 5: Dear Diary,
Even though our quest for diamonds went unfinished I made sure we found a new one. Making a rental for noobs like we were. I remember being poor and not having enough to eat I don't want that to happen to other people.

Page 1:               Day 1§0
§0---------------------§0
§0    I just met this world they call minecraft. I decided to log my whole life into this journal. Every memory or event that happens to me will go in here day by day.§0
§0
§0   Today the most wonderful
Page 2: thing happend. I was mining and I found some diamonds! I think I might use them to make a pickaxe so I can start constructing my house.  I want an old style house with a big roof. §0
§0
§0   It is starting to get lonley in this world 
Page 3: I wish I could find a companion.§0
§0
§0 Wow! I was walking home from my mine and I ran into a wolf. I used some bones to tame him, I guess now I won't be so lonley.. I think I will name is Ralph. Yea, me and Ralph sounds good.
Page 4:               Day 2§0
§0----------------------    Today me and ralph went to the pond. We sat there and fished for hours upon hours. I am starting to get better at this thing they call "life". One day I think I could actually do something.§0
§0Meh. Lets just 
Page 5: build for now.§0
§0
§0   I just started the construction of my house. It is a very lonley sad looking house. It seems to have nothing to bring in life. I need shelter so I guess I will have to live with my terrible building skills.
Page 6: I wish I could be like the other people. For some reason I seem to be an outcast in the minecraft community. I don't get it yet, maybe it just takes time. 
Page 7:                Day 3§0
§0----------------------§0
§0   I havn't been on this world very long. But it seems like forever with no friends. I feel lonley again, I have thoughts of quitting but I just don't. I have a feeling something will happen to me. Something bad
Page 8: later but good now. I feel like it will be the biggest adventure of my life. But who am I to think that. I am just another square.§0
§0
§0    I finally touched up my house a little bit. It still looks dark and lonley but I added some flowers to make it look 
Page 9: nicer. Just in case one day I happen to run into another person on this forsaken Earth.§0
§0
§0            Day 4§0
§0---------------------        I decided to ditch the old house and move by a pond. I really wanted to try and feel better. I figured the water could
Page 10: help my depression. Plus me and Ralph love to fish together.§0
§0
§0   For some reason Ralph seems like fishing is a bore. I am starting to get worried because he usually has a blast out here. He runs in the water and gets his long white hair wet
Page 11: and then shakes it off. I find it cute. I wonder if he is sick at all. I wouldn't know. I am just an idiot.§0
§0
§0              Day 5§0
§0----------------------     This very goreous girl joined my world! I am filled with happiness, I have never been this 
Page 12: happy ever in my life! I don't know how to explain the over welming love I have for this person. For some reason It makes me beleive in love at first site! I would try to talk to her but I doubt she would even find me remotely attractive, Im a loner.
Page 13:              Day 6§0
§0----------------------     I finally spoke to her, she seemed like a very nice person. I really like her, I hope someday we can be together in the same house and share the same love for things. The thing I find most attractive about her
Page 14: is her long blonde curly hair with her baby blue eyes. I can't explain it, she reminds me of the brightest diamond and the hottest torch. §0
§0
§0   I just showed her Ralph. I think she really likes him, this will give me a chance to hang out with her and 
Page 15: finally not be sad.§0
§0
§0              Day 7§0
§0----------------------      I finally worked up the nerve to speak a word to her. She said my nervousness was cute. This made me feel good inside. I hope I can capture this feeling forever!
Page 16:     I asked her if she wanted to come over and we can have a picnic under the stars. I am still waiting for a reply, I think she will say yes, but you never know.§0
§0
§0   Two whole hours later which felt like years she finally received my letter.
Page 17:     Yes, I had to send her a letter even though she lives across the street. I was too nervous she would turn me down and I would ruin everything.§0
§0
§0             Day 8§0
§0----------------------   Wr finally went on our first date! I am so happy!
Page 18: I am so in love, she said that she really likes me and she is thinking of marriage. This is so good for, I can finally be a normal "square" in this society of Minecraft.§0
§0
§0               Day 9§0
§0----------------------       Today is a bad day, Ralph has died
Page 19: my first companion of this brutal world. My sadness overwelms me, even though I am happy I am sad. Can anyone explain this!!§0
§0
§0   I miss Ralph so much! I just want to go fishing with him again. I want to see him wave the water off his fur. Ohhhh I miss him
Page 20: this is terrible! I hope you guys reading this in the future can understand my grief.§0
§0
§0   My future wife April is a wise lady, she tells me that everything has a purpose and I will soon find out why he died. I just hope that is soon.
Page 21:               Day 10§0
§0----------------------     Today is our marriage, even though I was just sad I feel nothing now. All I feel is love and passion for my wife April. I hope we can live in our newly  bought mansion by the lake. I think I can move on with
Page 22: my life. I am starting to think I can be happy in life, it seemed like I was always sad. Now I feel happiness.§0
§0
§0   I just held my first sword, I never used to fight mobs. I just ran and ran to shelter, yes you could say I was a weak person but
Page 23: I was afraid of the zombie and the creepers. The things that scare me the most are the skeletons. They are so accurate with their stupid bows and arrows. I started to learn how to use sword because I need to protect my lovely wife. Her life means
Page 24: everything.§0
§0
§0                Day 11§0
§0----------------------     I am panicing right now, I heard recent news of a zombie invasion. They have tooken over all the cities around us! I am scared for my life and everyone I love.
Page 25: my one focus right now is protecting my wife. She is the world and I couldn't live without her. §0
§0
§0   There is no keeping tracks of the days anymore. We have sat in this house closet  for I don't know how many days. I don't have the
Page 26: mental copacity to keep track of the days right now. I am going insane! The constant threat of zombies around our house. I am starting to think out defenses are getting weak. This house was built to live in not to withhold a zombie invasion!
Page 27:    We are both scared, My wife is shaking in my arms, I have no idea what to do. I can't fight the zombies there is more than 1,000 outside, they would just take my life and love from my wife.§0
§0
§0    I think it has been 9-10 hours since my last journal 
Page 28: entry. I don't know what day it is, all I know is we are going to die. I hope we can die in each others arms so death can come get us together.§0
§0
§0THERE IN THERE IN I CAN'T DO ANYTHING APRIL APRIL! SHE IS BEING DRAGGED
Page 29: THE ZOMBIES HAVE HER. I AM SORRY MY LOVE. I AM HIDING IN A CLOSET SCARED FOR MY LIFE. I WILL COME FOR YOU!§0
§0
§0   She has been gone, it feels like weeks, months or years! I don't know! All I know is I am coming for her.
Page 30:    I started training today. I am training to be a master at fighting these horrible beast. They will pay for what they did. None of them will live, all will die at the end of my sword. Their blood will spill everywhere. Their lives is the payment
Page 31: for taking my love.§0
§0
§0    I have been training for what feels like 10 days straight. I complete excercises like swinging my sword and kicking hay bails. I am gaining strength, I havn't ate all day I am running of pure adrenaline.
Page 32:    I am starting my journey, I will find my love, I will kill every beast that walks in my way. THIS DAY MARKS A CHANGE IN THE WORLD.§0
§0
§0   She was right, I have a purpose and I have found it. To save her.
Page 33:    I finally have stepped outside the doors. I will not be writing for awhile, I will be slaying and cutting the heads off these beast.§0
§0
§0  I managed to find a hiding spot to sleep tonight. I am in a tree, a birch tree to be exact. This feels like a safe 
Page 34: place to rest. No hiding only rest, I will wake up as early as possible find some food to ration and be on my way.§0
§0
§0   I am stuck on a roof surrounded by zombies. There is no way I can survive. I have to stay here until the zombies think I am gone.
Page 35:     It is the middle of the night, I just had the wildest dream ever. April came to me in my dream and spoke to me. All she said was a riddle. "A place to chase, and have a happy face". §0
§0
§0   THAT'S IT! I KNOW THE ANSWER TO THE RIDDLE!
Page 36: I used to take Ralph to the park and chase him. Playing with made me smile. She is hinting for me to come to the park. I know it! She is there! Oh thank you god! THANK YOU!§0
§0
§0  It is an hour walk to park, I set out at night so I could try and sneak past 
Page 37: the beast. I grabbed one torch to help guide me through the night.§0
§0
§0    UH OH! I have made a mistake I am trapped in a bathroom being swarmed by zombies. I cannot do anything. Please god help me! HELP! 
Page 38:     My eyes went black, all I saw was green faces and a brutal world. I saw the light, someone spoke to me, someone I didn't know. They said " You can do it ". After that I felt a pull, almost like being pulled back down to earth. I woke up and jolted! I
Page 39: somehow was alive and ok. Maybe it was a dream, just maybe. I continued to the park, it was still pitch black and I had lost my torch for the night. I was working of pure instinct. I finally made it. There she WAS APRIL WAS THERE!§0
§0I AM FILL WITH JOY!
Page 40:    I ran up to her, I tried to hug her and say " I love you ". But when she turned I saw her real form. They had turned her. She was one with the beast. I didn't know what to do. I knew I had to the right thing. My love and I...........
Page 41:     I kneeled her down and confessed my love.§0

Page 42:   I sat there, saw the beast coming. I held my love in my arms, sat there and just thought about our lives.§0

§0~~~~~~~~~~~~~~§0
§0Day 1: Well I just went to survival and went to a friends house! His username was Can_Bot and he gave me a diamond sword. I had no place to stay so he let me stay in one of the hotel rooms for free! Kendreek was with me,
Page 1: but he went to go griefing. I went to go griefing too like make snowmen from a house of snow. or made wood logs into wood planks.§0
§0
§0Day 2: I basically got some loot and put it in some chests. I learned to put signs so other people cant steal. I also
Page 2: explored the place and found an admin's house! IT WAS MADE OF DIAONDS! WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO? I mined a diamond block with a stone pick-axe, what a noob move, I didn't get the block. then the admin came and told me to put the block back or he'll ban 
Page 3: me but I said  I used a stone pick-axe and so he banned me for a week.§0
§0Day 3: well I'm back and I just went around not griefing anymore.... but I stole a horse! It wasn't named or owned by someone so it's their falt. It had iron armor! 
Page 4: Day 4: My friend stole my horse becuase I dont have a name tag. soo I went to steal a new one, and get a name tag, and get XP from the grinder! I named it Hutson.§0
§0
§0Day 5: Today I went through some nether portals and happened to find someone's
Page 5: iron golem grinder, It had a piston to kill them and hoppers to collect them. But I went to kill them and collect the irom before it went to the hopper! I got like 3 stacks! LOL! I ended up making an iron golem and named it Bob. I also got a snowman and
Page 6: named it Olaf!§0
§0
§0Day 6: My friend found a spider spawner under his base and made a  grinder. It sucked so I improved it for him!§0
§0
§0Day 7: Well... for some reason the spawner is gone, but I went to vote for the server
Page 7: and got a bunch of mums! I also went to craft enchanteed DIAMOND ARMOR! Man I really want to see the look on Can_Bot's face, but he is always offline when I'm here. O'l well.§0

    Not too rich,
 Only enough to fit.
Once upon a time their were three kingdoms.
One was poor.
One was rich,
One was enough.
Now the poor kingdom was full of...well poor people. They longed for being healthy and soon enough they
Page 1: rioted and killed the king and his guards.
They traveled to the rich kingdom. Now they were spoiled with wealth and greed. Soon murders took place for the right of more riches. Jewels and jealousy overcame stony hearts and they went forth and slew the
Page 2: rich king for his treasure. The guards too. However the now rich people felt guilty and went to the third kingdom where they sought out a place that would fit their needs.
Especially without turning their hearts cold or weak.

Page 3: So the people went unto the third kingdom and lived there without too many riches or being too poor. Living a happily ever after in a life of comfort that they had enough.

Page 1:          Day Two         It is a bright day. Puffy clouds, gentle breeze. But not for long. Me and my love travel to the Underworld - a deadly place indeed. We collected what we needed, while narrowly doding pouring, steaming hot lava! When we came back? 
Page 2: Turns out to be another portal. Someone else's. Another home. We traveled home from there. It was very long and tiring. About halfway there, I saw..an amazing site. An entire grove upon grove of flowers, all shapes and colors! It was truly amazing, I 
Page 3: had asked Nathan to stop. I collected many flowers, almost too much for my weak self to carry. We did make it home, and went right to our bed rooms, throwing all of our items to the floor. What an adventure today was! -O
Page 4:           Day 3           It was absolutely outrageous! First chickens had appeared, then men riding on chickens, then water! It was insane! I thought I was going mad, but Nathan saw it too! Living here is great but equally horrifying at times, yet it 
Page 5: still fascinates me too watch the sun rise and fall, the moon making the same efforts. It is amazing to see, especially when you have someone there to be with you, holding your hand. -O
Page 6:           Day 4             I spent most of my day carefully setting red wool into a pathway to our garden, falling a few times but not too much harm done. It was tiring indeed. When I came back, Nathan calls me over. Very sleepy and weak, I sigh and nod,
Page 7: letting out a groan as he points to the ladder leading to the roof. More climbing. I follow and scowl as I see nothing. He points ahead, telling me "soon". What does that mean? About an hour later he tells me to follow him again, after I showed him the 
Page 8: path (He loved!). I smile and follow eagerly, my body feeling strong and rejuvinated. He leads me down a brightly lit hallway with stone on either side. Then I see it. A beautiful balcony with a bench, posts above it to keep rain away. I stare at it in 
Page 9: shock as he sits down patiently. I tell him how amazing it is, and kiss him pationetly. He deserved it. It is a beautiful sight to see, as he holds me in his arms and we watch the sun slowly rise. A great day indeed. -O
Page 10:         Day Five          A lonely day. A horde of wild Ocelots came into our house, and Nathan went fishing, to bring fish back and tame them. I waited most of the day, somehow crafting a chest for food storage. I didn't want to be alone all day. So I 
Page 11: too made a fishing pole, along with shearing the sheep and fixing the floor. Today was a very light day, not a lot of work. I cut a few trees for the chest, but it was not tiring for my bones at all. -O
Page 12:           Day 6             There is no weather. Except for crackling lightning going on forever it seems. Nathan seems fine by it, welcomes it as I get more worried every moment. It keeps crashing like waves against rocks. After a while of silence, only 
Page 13: our picks occasionally tapping against rocks he shouts out "STOP" and holds an arm out to stop me. I do, of course. He looks around wildly, leaving me hopelessly confused. After a moment he whispers "Lava..". My eyes gross wide and I tell him we should 
Page 14: leave, but he simply smiles and shakes his head, only tapping blocks carefully every so often. After a while he must have found it because he told me to step back and did himself, carefully knocking the stone out to reveal lava! He quickly throws another 
Page 15: stone onto it to cover it up. I've..never been so scared! I grab onto him the moment I see it but he looks back at me and laughs, telling me it's perfectly safe now. When we get out of here I hope to never return! -O
Page 16:           Day 7             I don't know how long we were in there, but I sure do hope we never return! It was exciting, equally horrifying mentally and physically. Nathan almost died! I was scared for his life! But we made it, alive. I'm not sure how we 
Page 17: made it back, but once we saw the light we ran out of that mine like there was no tomorrow...we lived.-O
Page 18:           Day Eight       Today we made new clothes, did our hair, practically had a makeover. I now where my hair over my shoulders with my bangs covering one eye, flowers ringed in my hair. Nathan wears a band around his forehead and darker clothing. -O
Page 19:            Day Nine       It's been...very lonely. Nathan has gone down to the mines, in search for gold. I await him, attempting to write this but my mind is on him; I miss him. I am nothing without him, I can't focus. I hope he is okay. I decide to 
Page 20: clear my mind, and travel to find wheat or cows. This only makes me more distracted seeing our balcony. I sit down and watch the night pass, my head in my knees, pressed to my chest. I must find him soon.... -O
Page 21:         Day Ten          We ventured out, searching for cows to give us milk. We got lost. He had found the Nether portal, and took it. After about ten minutes, I realized he was nowhere in sight. He would have came back. I began to worry, and ran home...
Page 22: only to find him nearby, searching the house. Once he sees me his face lights up, and we charge to each other, slamming into the other like magnents. After hours of rejoicing we finally wire down, sitting on the balcony and watching carefully, my head on 
Page 23: his shoulder, his arm around my shoulder in a gentle hold to his chest. We speak softly, and every so often he kisses my head. It is a good day after all. -O
Page 24:          Day Eleven     Today we finally found those cows..after a while of attempting to make cakes, in which we suceeded we went out to enjoy it with some milk. Nathan smiled and offered to get it. I sprinted out when I heard his cry in shock. I ran
Page 25: outside to find not only our cows gone but our chickens! We managed to get more after hours, wiped out through flesh and bone. We collapsed onto our bed and both passed out in moments. Today was interesting. -O
Page 26:          Day Twelve     Not much happened today. I fished, taking my items and placing them carefully in a chest. I'm usually the one who falls and drops things into pits or holes..so I left it all here. I'm sure he will know by seeing my things. I 
Page 27: was very careful stepping off each patch of dirt, knowing I could easily fall. But what would I lose? My fishing pole can be replaced, my food can too. Once I got to the water it was..breathtaking. Watching the water slowly slide over the peachy pink sand
Page 28: like the color of cheeks when blushing. I took my shoes off, tapping my feet in the water and watching the rings escape my feet like soundwaves. Eventually I realized I was supposed to be fishing, and started. I watched carefully, keeping a good stare on 
Page 29: the bobber, watching the water push over it and knock it down, only to pop it back up. I didn't catch much fish, but I did collect a pufferfish. When I came home I realized I couldn't cook it. I cooked the other fish, watching the flames crackle and being
Page 30: careful not to gulf the fish in flames. I tried the pufferfish. The moment it reached my lips I was crying out in pain. Nathan came to my aid, but there was no saving me. The pain was unbearable. I was sure I was going to die, grabbing his hand with tears
Page 31: rolling past my eyes. As soon as it started, it stopped, although slamming ever ten seconds, sending me into another wave of pain. Later it did stop, and Nathan quickly threw the fish away as I curled into the bed, weak and sore. I didn't like today. -O
Page 32: 
Page 33:           Thirteen        I was presented with an amazing surprise. My favorite color is purple, naturally. Nathan told me to go behind our secret wall for a moment. When he told me I could come out, all the windows were tinted purple! I could see the 
Page 34: glint in my eyes through the sparkling ameythst colored glass...it was beautiful.
Page 35:           Fourteen       Another lazy day, yet in some form romantic. We spent the entire day fishing. But here's what made it special: It was me and Nathan. Cracking jokes, kissing, giggling as we wave our fish at each other. I loved watching the bobber 
Page 36: plop under the clear, ice cold water as a fish bit down, visible  as it shook violently. We cooked them and I think Nathan made a cake (I bet for himself too!). It was huge! Sparkling with a thick layer of icing at the top, he dug into that straight away.
Page 37:           Fifteen         The night before my birthday. I'm not too excited for some reason, but Nathan keeps hugging me tightly and wishing me a happy birthday eve. He says we should keep fishing. I nod as we walk down the path to the water. After a 
Page 38: while he gets up, and tells me he will be back in an hour. I continue fishing, although my thoughts are clouded. What is he doing? Where did he go? As if he read my thoughts, I hear him shout my name happily. I drop my fishing pole, letting it clatter 
Page 39: onto the wood as I sprint and climb (and trip) my way up. He smiles as I get up, covered in dirt. He takes my hand and pulls me to our balcony. "Open the doors." He whispers into my ear. Confused, I do. In moments my jaw drops to the floor, my eyes huge
Page 40: as I stare around the room. He knows I love books...he made a library! Before I can stop myself I hurl myself into the library, sprinting to and fro like a child. He laughs after watching me for a while, then picks me up and kisses me pationetly. I decide
Page 41: to return the favor, gently slipping my tongue into his mouth. His eyes grow wide, his cheeks crimson but he pulls away. "That's my thanks," I tell him. He laughs and carries me to the balcony, where I snuggle close to him and watch the moon.
Page 42:            Sixteen        Today was interesting. We found and tamed two cats, one for Nathan and one for myself. I showed him how to feed them, and I fed my own...and...well..they mated! Before we knew it there was a tiny kitten perched by the fireplace
Page 43: purring and squealing. After a while I finally agreed to let them have another, this time a black cat (the other was orange as our original cat was, mine was black and white.). They grew up, but we still kept an eye on them. -O
Page 44:          Seventeen      It is night time. Nathan and I have traveled far and wide, and back. We found a very nice house, the owner letting us stay the night before we continued our quest. When we arrived at our door step, Nathan frowned. I asked him what 
Page 45: was bothering him, but he shook his head, "Our house...so..small. That man's house was huge." he replies. I roll my eyes, "Not alot we can do." He smiles, and nods, looking to me. "...Or can we." He told me to go get wood. I spent the day chopping trees, 
Page 46: stopping by to drop the lumber off to him every so often as I watched him form dirt on the side of our house. After several trips and most of the day gone, when I dropped the wood off he picked me up and smiled, "Our house will be ready soon. We just have
Page 47: to build it." What in the world does that meam? Every time I stopped by, more wood outlined the place. Once it was filled he picks me up again. "Honey, I have built our home." My jaw drops, but he simply kisses me, the sun sparkling like stars in his eyes
Page 48: as he smiles, his face shining. "Happy birthday, my love." He whispers into my ear, gently nibbling on it. I still stare in shock, but my cheeks began to turn a rosy red. I was blushing...this hadn't happened in a while. I look to him, and smile..kissing 
Page 49: him deeply. "I....I love you. So much...let's get to this house. " I grin and take his hand, slowly walking into the opening that would serve the door to our new home.

Page 0:          Eighteen         The house is turning out quite nicely. The flying man stopped by again, and asked us if we were married. Laughing, Nathan and I clasped hands. "Oh...not quite yet." I answer, and look to him, smiling. "Soon to be, this is just a 
Page 1: vacation. But if we like it here enough, I already do, we might just stay a while longer." Nathan smirks impishly and bites onto my ear, meaning for me to blush. It works. I smile shyly and push him off but he simply picks me up, nibbling on my earlobe 
Page 2: again. The man laughs and shakes his head, with a wave he vanishes.                          Hours Later     We finished the second floor, and have created room structures. Nathan is building them, and he keeps saying, "I know it is your birthday, but 
Page 3: since i'm doing all this work I deserve some type of reward..." Then he winks and continues. I have noticed he is being more affectionate - aggressive, too...in the good way. He pushes me into a wall, kissing me. Picking me up and kissing me. Sliding his 
Page 4: tongue in my mouth, holding onto my waist while we kiss, swinging me around, biting my ear, kissing my neck...is this a sign of something? -O
Page 5:          Nineteen         Our Home: It is going nicely. We are replacing the carpet, filling in windows. I chopped lots of wood down, my hands sore, blistered and weak. When I come home Nathan too is tired, and often we sit down, eat dinner and go to 
Page 6: sleep. It is too warm for covers so we lay atop of them, either facing oppisite ways or often my head on his chest, his arm draped over my shoulder. -O
Page 7:            Twenty          A lot happened today. I was digging, or trying to dig most of the land below the house out. It was very tiring and my picks and shovels continued to break before me. I came up to visit Nathan quite often, his eyes weary as he 
Page 8: sheared sheep, making carpet of their very wool. We found a cook wandering a'bout our lands, calling out for a home to stay in. We offered, and he said he would cook. He has done nothing but drink. I plan to kick him out, but Nathan says not to, he can 
Page 9: help. I noticed how...strong Nathan looks. Fit. Tall, healthy, handsome, very strong(his abs are -very- noticeable!). He looks amazing. It was only today I realized I look similar. Not very strong, but very slim, my body looking less frail and weak. I 
Page 10: have adapted to this place...I plan to stay. Every morning we watch the sunrise, kiss, then go off on our goals, stopping by frequently for talk and meals. Nathan seems weary after each day, but he looks so...amazingly strong as he hauls wood up and down 
Page 11: to our house. He took his shirt of last night and man, was I amazed. You could see about six creases where his abs were...he had a six pack! My fingertips traced along his chest and he laughs, kissing my forehead before we settle down to rest. -O
Page 12:         Twenty One        We have finally finished the house. Nathan had done much of the work, but I did everything I could. He looks so strong, but I do fear for him as he cuts trees. If he got hurt...who knows what I would do. He went outside last 
Page 13: night, and I watched in horror as what seemed to be a Skeleton wearing Armor lunged at him, arrow flung into the bow, aiming. Before the creature could let go I hurled myself forward, slicing it in half, armor and all. I blinked and slowly stood, looking 
Page 14: to Nathan in shock. "Did I..do..this?" He noded and smiled, telling me I did well as we went back inside. I realized then if I saw him get hurt I would kill his foe. I would risk my life for a man like him. I love him with..everything I have. -O
Page 15:        Twenty Two         I wish not go outside during the night. I was fishing, to feed to our cats. I had looked down peacefully...and my heart dropped. I let out a horrified scream, but covered my mouth as not to wake Jonathan. Too late. He was there,
Page 16: in minutes with a sword in his hand, screaming my name. I looked down to find a huge, rotten-fleshed missing, lip snarling, crazed zombie trying to snap the ladder, a smaller at his side. Nathan killed the big one soon and I nervously slid down the ladder
Page 17: with a laugh as the zombie nibbled at my leg. But my laugh cut short, turning into another horrified cry as he struck, and I slammed my pickaxe into his very skull, my breath heavy.
           Later            I wish to stay inside so I decided to..gift
Page 18: Nathan. I pulled my hair out of its normal ponytail, brushing my bangs over my eyes (of course putting eye makeup on before). I added blush, took my armor off and wore my shortest shorts, my cutest matching top. I lay on the bed carefully, awaiting his 
Page 19: return patiently while petting my feline friend Sammie perched on the bed waiting for me. I can wait as long as I need to. -O
Page 20:         Twenty Three
Last night was..amazing. He hadn't been hinting at all, just really attracted. When he saw me perched on the bed, half asleep he scooped me up right away (which woke me) and told me to put my hands on the glass. I did and..well...we 
Page 21: um..mated. I'd only seen the cats do it which was disturbing but now I understand why they do it so much..it feels amazing. I felt..this..liquid going inside of me and he relaxed, pulling me down next to him and we cuddled, but in minutes we both passed 
Page 22: out cold. I woke today to see a bright smile on his face, his breath slow and soft as he slept. I kiss his cheek, and now I write this. He said it was "sex."...Man did it feel good. I wish I could do it again but he said we need to wait a little. -O
Page 23:          Twenty Four      Well, he went to collect sand. He asked me to continue digging underneath the house so if we were to fall we will land in water. But I don't feel like it. I want to feel his soft lips on mine...his warm chest pressed to mine as 
Page 24: we lay on the bed, me on the bottom of course. So, I will wear my normal clothes, armor. But I will keep my hair, and with a change of make up, the same. I want to..he called it...making out? -O
Page 25:        Twenty Five         I felt slightly bad for keeping him up but he seemed alright. I handed him my book when he settled down onto the bed, and he immediatly..well..did it. I felt his soft lips press deeply to mine, his warm skin push on mine. It was
Page 26: wonderful. I wanted to advance it to a little more...rough kissing, but he said we would wait until the morning, kiss my cheek, my neck, and closed his eyes. As always I laid my head on his chest, we fell asleep fast just like the night before... -O
Page 27:          Twenty Six
It was a long, horrible, and hot day. We went to the Nether. I don't know how long we were there...but it took us a long time. We wanted to find, he called it, "Glowstone". I had wanted to stay home and dig as a surprise, or take care 
Page 28: of our cats but I chose to go with him. I wasn't sure how it was like in there, and I thought to give it a go. After awhile I ended up taking my armor off, only wearing my shorts, tanktop and shoes. It was that hot in there, and luckily I brought my 
Page 29: bag with me (That I always carry) and stuffed my armor inside. After a while we finally left, coming out of a different portal of course. I looked around the small house, then to the balcony. As I slowly peeked over the edge, I saw a nice, cool, shady 
Page 30: looking pool. Before I could yell I was going to jump in I was crying out in surprise as a firm hand was placed on my back, pushing me forward down into the stream. I quickly swam to the top, flipping my now wet bangs up to look to the figure who pushed 
Page 31: me, only to be drenched as Nathan jumped in and landed next to me, water sloshing over me. We were laughing for awhile, splashing at each other and kissing every so often. Once we got tired we slowly waded to the shore, sitting on the sand with our arms
Page 32: over the others shoulders, our head's leaned in together. My eyes began to feel heavy as we layed down against the sand, and I went to tell Nathan. When I looked over I saw his chest slowly, calmly move up and down, his breath soft. He was asleep, so I 
Page 33: decided to join him. I kissed his forehead and pulled his arm over my shoulder again, falling into a heavy sleep. -O
Page 34:          Twenty Seven     The days seem to go by in a haze, I don't even remember if it is day twenty seven. Nathan has been creating potions...deadly ones. And he has me as his assistant, which, I willingly do but i'm beginning to regret. He has me try a
Page 35: poison and it stung like hell...his antidote did nothing. I collapsed, curling into a ball as tears swam down my eyes. He didn't seem as concered, more..interested in the result. He handed me another antidote, and threw a poison to my head. As soon as the
Page 36: crashing wave of pain hovered over my head I swallowed the antidote. I felt no pain, very little after about a minute or so. It did not last, thankfully. He is making more potions, I think he is..well...going a little mad with this. Like a wall, building 
Page 37: up around him and his potions. I know he doesn't see it, and I do not know what to do. I pray he does not see this. -O
Page 38:         Twenty Eight       Today was not painful. A bunch of bats were nearby but I shooed them off. I was still used as an expierement but today was nice. I was sped up, then got to breathe underwater and another potion he threw at me (which hurt alot),
Page 39: made me see quite clearly. It was..quite nice. He still seems distracted. Shivering to the bone, I asked if I could go inside after instead of digging. He said yes, I could, and he would continue his studies. -O
           Later   
I dried off and set 


Page 40: into my casual wear, and sat on the edge of the bed. My gaze wandered to Nathan's book, perched ontop of the chest. My eyes narrowed, and I grabbed it. But after awhile I gasped..he was nowhere near mad. He was only protecting me, and I didn't realize how
Page 41: terrible he felt. I plan to apologize right away. It was I who was cruel, not him. I also found out he was jealous of the water. And the horses we found outside. I tamed one happily and easily, he had a little difficulty trying to prove better. What an
Page 42: adoring man he is. I just wish I knew he wasn't..well..insane. -O
Page 43:       Twenty Nine
I...I don't know what to say. Nathan had this potion he made to slow me down which made me nervous so I ran. He caught up with me and threw the potion. It struck me in the back. I couldn't run as fast at all, practically walking. He 
Page 44: seized me by the waist and push me into a very small pit, closing it off. I tried running but he knocked the dirt out from under me, to where my head was at his waist. He pulled off his armor and pants, telling me to open. I told him no. Out of his pack 
Page 45: he pulled out -flint and steel-...and said if I didn't...if I didn't suck his dick he would set me aflame. Not wanting to die, I did. I tried to make it over quicker by licking his balls and that did help a bit. Once he gooed in my mouth and made sure I 
Page 46: swallowed he told me he should keep me in that foul pit, only coming when he "needed" me. I crawled out and jumped onto the dirt, and ran into our house to hide. I'm..horrified. I write this now with shaking hands. What is his next plan? If he threatens 
Page 47: me again I will take my damned horse, cat, and leave. What is he going to do? Tie me up before I run? No, he can't. I could run faster before he dares throw a potion at me. I hide in the library he made for me, crouched low. I hear him up above, calling 
Page 48: my name out and the occasional snap or crack. I concealed myself carefully, slipping through the door intime. If it's closed he won't think i'm in there. If he does...i'm not sure what i'll do. But I have time to form a plan. If he comes down I shall 
Page 49: knock him out with a book to the head. I just pray it works. This will be my last entry for some time I believe... -O

Page 0: Jonathan's Journal
House Cords: X-3342
Z-4751 Direction-N

         -Day 1-
Built a suguar cane farm and ventured out to bring back leather to make books. One for me and my lover. At night a thunderstorm came into the area so i built a brick fireplace
Page 1: Waiting for the thunderstorm to subside.

            Day 2
Not much can be said for this one. I headed out with a pick-axe and dug a line straight through a mountain and built the foundation, awating to show it to my love,
Page 2:           Day 3
I finished the balcony for my love and plan to show her in the morning. I cut down some trees in order to have enought supplies to make it. I noticed she really seems to bring animals home so tomorrow, with axe in hand i will go out and 
Page 3: make our animal pen bigger with the wood i will find.
           Day 4
We awoke early so i could show her the balcony i have built in my spare time. I am pretty sure she liked it almost as much as i did. I snuck over to the farm to find a rather pleasant
Page 4: suprise. A fully grown watermelon. That i happen to take and eat a few minutes later of course. As night feel i climbed down to the ground and worked on the bottom of the house to help hide out little love get-a-way house from people who wish to damage 
Page 5: our house. I am writing this with weak hands as i am tired and wish to sleep now. No plans for tomorrow.
          -Day 6-
Apparently i did have plans as i awoke and found these strange cat-like animals in our home. My love told me we need fish. So i did
Page 6: Just that. I went grabbed my fishing rod and went to find some. Along the way i explained and taught her how to make one.
This might be useful in the future.

Page 7:            Day X
I have no idea what day it is. Mining and can no longer tell the time. I came across a river of lava and cafefully crossed it making a cobble bridge. I asked my love if we needed redstone and quickly mined it with her approval. My pick 
Page 8: broke on the first one but luckily i brough a back up. I will continue writing as i move on.
          Day x
I have no idea if a day has past or not since i have been down here.
It sure seems like it.
My hands and back both ache from destroying minerals 
Page 9: and moving them elsewhere. I am writing in this as i wait for the obsidian to cool down before i walk aross it in search of diamonds and other things to help our lives go by eaiser. Hard work but someone has to do it. I write this with haste as i was 
Page 10: mining and feel into another mining shaft with a gleam of light at the end of the tunnel.
I found it, diamond. They shinest thing i have ever seen and i will make sure to take my time and carefully take them from the stone they bury themselfs in, A few 
Page 11: hours have past im sure as i took my time mining this rock, find four beatiful, brillant
stones we call diamond. With my reason of leaving a completed i quickly looked for my way out of this cramped and dark cave so i can show my love what i have found. 
Page 12:             Day X
I awoke from my sleep against a wooden post in the mines. I have no idea where i am so, i starting doing the only thing i knew how to get out of here. I started digging up. I came across a breathtaking ravine, that was covered from the
Page 13: top. This is the place i am writing from but i must stop now for i wish to return to my love, for i miss her greatly.

           Day X
I have reach the surface and oh did i miss the smell of fresh air. There is nothing like it when your lungs are filled 
Page 14: the smell of coal and lava.
That is for another time though. I was greeted by Olivia the moment a returned home and couldnt ask for a better way of returning after how many days i was down there. I rested my feet for few hours as i watched the sunset. I 
Page 15: placed the ore i collected in the furnace and headed out to find a cow, we could use milk. Getting tired of lake water...Reminder: Ask Olivia what day it is and how long i was down there.

            Day 11
I had a peak through Olivias book to find out 
Page 16: how long i was down mining, apparently 2 days. Felt like only a few hours with all excitment of finding priceless gems...i am eager to return from the feelings of overwhelming joy i had finding them. But there is another side of me that does not wish to 
Page 17: return. In fear of dying and never seeing my love again. But i promised her i would be safe so i take every measurement i can to keep that promise.

           Day 12
Found 2 cows and spent most of the day trailing them back to our house. I was greeted by
Page 18: Olivia which i love so much and we watched the sunset together, like always.

           Day 13
We exploring in order to find another cow for our other one to mate with. The leather is so useful but the milk that comes with it is even more impressive.
Page 19: With the milk i had in hand i headed to the kitchen and prepared a cake in surprise for Olivia. (I mostly ate it all) Im sure she enjoyed the little cake she had. Reminder: Bake another cake for her: I also made some cookies but i was exhausted for some 
Page 20: reason and decided to sleep the night away, Olivia by my side as always.

          Day 14
I awoke from my sleep and had a craving for the cookies i baked yesterday, i ran outside to get milk for them and to my suprise, poof! Our cows, sheep and even my 
Page 21: little chicken who supplied the eggs, gone! I yelled for Olivia to come outside and later in the day we aqquired new animals, from a strange man who appeared to be able to fly! I like the think they arent new and our old ones decided to come back for us.
Page 22:             Day 14
Nothing much happened today to be honest. I reworked the hidden door to take less redstone and built -another- secret cave hidden behind a painting. I was bored at the time and wanted to impress Olivia, although i know she already loves
Page 23: me enough. Peaceful and relaxing day with hardwork thrown in. Perfect.

           Day 15
It started with an idea i had when awaking. I asked Olivia to build me a shover...teaching her first of course. I headed out and collected so much my shovel broke in
Page 24: hands.

           Day 16
This is a lazy day i have to admit. Just sitting on the balcony catching up on writing in my journal with Olivia by my side once again. Awaiting for the sand in the furnace to get so hot it turns into glass for her surpirse. As i
Page 25: returned how to check on the animals. (Mainly for wool) I turned around just as a zombie approached me! I jumped back startled but quickly regained control of the situation and plunged my sword straight through that bastards heart. Its what he...that 
Page 26: thing gets for attacking me.

           Day -14-
Apparently i read Olivias book wrong and got the days mixed up. This day was spent fishing with her and it was absolutly perfect. We mined some ice to make our very own fishing pool. I stood behind her, 
Page 27: my smile from her as i watch her beautiful hair flow effortlessly against the breeze. After that i went home quickly without telling her and returned to build a treehouse mixed with a fishing dock. With fish in hand we returned home and cooked it. I made
Page 28: sure to stay away from the pufferfish, since Olivias...accident. I didnt like seeing her in pain like that, even worse since i couldnt do anything. I no longer wish to think about this so i will sleep now.

          Day 15
I hidden and blocked myself in 
Page 29: the cave leading to the balcony, venturing to the market to buy bookshelfs. To my luck i ran out of money and had to build them myself. I carpeted the floor with wool from our sheep and with that finished. I eagerly came out of the once cramped and dark 
Page 30: cave to find myself in awe, realizing the work i have done this time. I impressed myself i have admit. I brought Olivia to show her, making her cover her eyes at first and...the look on her face as she spun around looking at the books. It made all that 
Page 31: hardwork with it. After i did my best to calm her down, i brought a few books with us to the balcony and we cuddled on the bench. Kissing a few times and watching the moon rise with our hands locked to each others.
        
           Day 16
Now with the 
Page 32: worked i put into the tunnel we came out of the cave and i noticed how actually small our house was. Olivia, in her shy nature would never straight up tell me the house needs to be bigger. But i knew.
Without discussing i started building the pillars of 
Page 33: which were made of pure wood (That my love collected) which stood in the air like a tower. With that done i added more ground to the side of our house. I wanted it to be huge, i wanted a relaxing house but mainly, i wanted Olivia to live happily in her 
Page 34: house with me. That was my main goal. I am writing this as i finished connecting the pillars to each other with planks. Laying down and watching the moon as i write. I will sleep up here, even though i know Olivia is near. I miss her greatly.

          
Page 35:            Day 17
The sun glaring in my eyes as i awake, stiff and sore.
I tough through it and continue working. My love stopping by every now and then to give me more materials for the house.
Night falls as i write this and stand back, looking up to the
Page 36: new expanded and i dare say the best damn house i have even seen and built.
I stare at it with an overwhelming sense of accomplishment. I did, i build the house. Noone else, me. (With help from Olivia of course!) We hold hands as we walk into our house, 
Page 37: dark and no furniture to be found. It wasnt enough, i wasnt done yet. I knew Olivia was fine with it but i didnt want just fine. -J

A few hours have passed and i have the upstairs carpeted and purple tinted glass for windows. (Olivias favorite color) I 
Page 38: have built a storage room, for storage of course. A bath room, again, the name explains it. A library for 'specially for Olivia, a bedroom, relaxing area (where i am writing this) and finally a working room for my crafts, smelting and potions. Oh and also
Page 39: a freezer and kitchen, i do this in hope Olivia notices i built them for her to cook dinner. Hah...call me crazy, i love that girl will all my heart but i fear her when she is angry and do not wish to ask so bluntly to cook me food. So for now i hint at 
Page 40: it as she did with the house.

           Day 18
We added some final touches to the house. Paintings, books, fireplace, chairs and a giant table for our meals. We lost our animals from creatures and monsters who wished to harm us during the building of 
Page 41: our home. A few attacked me but when they go for Olivia...just something inside me snaps. I feel so mercy for them, the only thing i want is for them to be dead and dead forever. They try and fail to attack my love and pay with their lives.
I no longer 
Page 42: to write about this so its time for sleep. On a side not i have noticed my "physical" apperance has changed over the time. I have to admit i like the way i look, i dont see whats so good about it but Olivia cant seem to keep her hands off me when we sleep
Page 43: at night in the bed. Says "Shirts arent that comfy to cuddle with!" I am sure they arent either but half of my thinks she says this just to touch my bare skin and muscles, i still dont see whats so "sexy" about them.

          Day 19
I spent the day
Page 44: cutting down trees and came across the most beautiful thing i have ever seen aside from seeing Olivia for the first time.
It was a...its hard to describe but i will try my best. It was a mountain, that was caved in and covered with snow and ice. Like 
Page 45: nothing i have seen before but as i neared i saw walls of stone amoung it. It was taken but i did not care much. After spending so much time building i just wanted to relax and live a little with Olivia in our new house. I gather as much wood and sand as 
Page 46: i can carry and head home, first leaving a sign to warn the person who built those walls to stay away from out house but as i returned i was quickly greeted (and kissed) by Olivia. She sat on the chair outside of the kitchen with the strange man running 
Page 47: in circles? He must have been drunk again. I layed down the sand-stone and we pushed him into the kitchen, he didnt seem to mind. -J
Night falls and as we went outside to watch the moon there was a sketelon but not a normal one. He had golden armor and 
Page 48: stared at us through the door. I grab my diamond sword preparing to fight off another monster trying to attack her but this time...this time i was surprised. As i ran out the doors to slay him Olivia jumped infront of me and cut the thing clean in half!

Page 49: He was still alive, being a skelton and all but i let her think she killed him as she trotted inside with a smirk saying "Girls can do anything men can do and better!" I remain silent and let her leave as i turn back to crush the skeletons head completely

STORY WRITTEN BY

INSPIRED BY THE CRUSHES OF HER PAST

ALL CHARACTERS ARE FICTIONAL AND DO NOT REPRESENT REAL PEOPLE //


Page 1: REVIEWS:

Still a better love story than twilight - Everyone

5/5 Would Finger to again - 80% of lesbians

Muttsworld Lesbian Erotica 2013 Award
Page 2: Audrey was a tall, long-haired brunette with brown eyes and the face of a goddess. She was everyone's dream. Unfortunately for the male population this woman was blessed with the curse of being a lesbian. Countless men and women were dumbstruck by her
Page 3: looks. The dominate, aggressive, Audrey had no preference for men. She enjoyed taking submissive women and turning them into her playtoys for the evening.

Audrey went to a coffee shop to get coffee. What the hell else would she get at
Page 4: a coffee shop? Condoms? NO. However, there was this cute girl named Sofia. She had a soft-round cute face. One you could fuck all night to.

Now that we have the two main characters in the scene. Let's get to the hot and sexy part. The shower....
Page 5: LLOOL JK WHO HAS SEX IN A SHOWER.

So, the two warmed things up nice and sweet with a shower. Some cute cuddling standing up and fondling tits and washing each other. As they are about to get dirty so I don't know why they didn't save
Page 6: the shower until after. Audrey gets tired after sex don't judge her.

Sofia lays down naked on the bed and Audrey is not slow to lay ontop of Sofia's wet naked body. Sofia and Audrey were both athletes so they had nice hot bodies.
Page 7: Hot too look at, not hot to touch atleast not until they started to fuck.

Things got hot.

The bed sheets melted.

The house caught on fire.

No bodies could be
Page 8: found in the charred remains of their hot, steamy, sexy, sex.

LOL JK that would be horrible. SO let's focus back onto the bed.

Now, I'm sure we all know what happens when to lovely lesbians get together
Page 9: in a bed. So, i'll spare you the details.

I'm sure your head can do the rest of the work. Add some strapons or only use one. Or two. Ten. Kinky shit man. Not litterally. 

The End.

Page 0: Diary of a CASTLEBUILDER!

Day One

It has been very hard. I have already bought all of the sand on the market to use for glass... The floor isn't even HALF DONE!
Page 1: Day Two

Still no sand on the market... And nobody has ten stacks to sell me either. I met a new guy called wario355. He was very useful...
Page 2: Day Three

This is getting interesting, i have found sand and wario355 seems to be trying to get close as if it's some kind of trap...
Page 3: Day Four

As I sit here writing this book, I realise the sand still hasn't cooked... WHAT SORCERY IS THIS!? I do think I may be going crazy...
WHAT IS HAPPENING!?
Although i haven't finished the floor yet, I do quite believe that it shall be finished...
Page 4: Day 4 (Pt. 2)

I am collecting the sand from the furnaces, I don't think i have enough... Only 6 stacks... BAH! Who am I kidding... LET'S DO THIS! Or maybe I should wait until the night is over...


Page 5: Day 4 (Pt. 3)

Now the night is over, I shall finish my castle floor! Yes, I am still on the floor... WOAH! Nearly fell today, and I may have misplaced one glass block, but that does not matter-
Page 6: Ending

-For i have finished!
(Well, at least the floor)

It is time to say farewell, look out for Vol. 2 in a few days, weeks, maybe months, if I get round to it, that is.

§0Day Five§0
§0
§0As I pick up my book and quill (Start pressing things on my keyboard), I realise how important to you this book must be. As I pick up my axe, i feel a sudden burst of
Page 1: hunger. I decide to grab some melons before I start my daily dose of deforestation! I start planning my wall(s). I then realise the dubstep I'm listening to is a remix of a J.B. song and turn it off. As I cut down my first tree, I realise it's bad for the
Page 2: environment. And so I continue, but replanting saplings and suffocation in them as they grow...§0
§0WHY ME!?§0
§0

Page 3: Day Six§0
§0
§0I have just logged on and decided to start the walls, I shall now leave this book in a safe place so that it does not come to me losing it.§0
§0
§0Already out of wood and I am nowhere near done. Although, all I
Page 4: need to add are glass and buildings... Did I mention the mushroom house I made?

Page 1:  Toward the end of the 1940s, Soviet researchers sealed five prison inmates in an airtight chamber and dosed them with an experimental stimulant gas to test the effects of prolonged sleep deprivation. 
Page 2: Their behavior was observed via two-way mirrors and their conversations monitored electronically. They had been promised their freedom if they could go entirely without sleep for 30 days.
Page 3: The first few days of the experiment passed uneventfully. By the fifth day, however, the subjects began showing signs of stress and were overheard bemoaning their circumstances. 
Page 4: hey stopped conversing with their fellow inmates, choosing instead to whisper compromising information about one another into the microphones, apparently in an effort to win the favor of the researchers. 
Page 5: Paranoia set §0in.On§0 the ninth day the screaming began. First one subject, then another, was observed running around the chamber screaming at the top of his lungs for hours on end. 
Page 6: Equally disconcerting was the reaction of the quieter subjects, who began ripping apart the books they'd been given to read, smearing the pages with feces, and plastering them over the mirrored windows so their actions could no longer be observed.
Page 7: Just as suddenly, the screaming stopped. The subjects ceased communicating altogether. Three long days passed without a sound from inside the §0chamber.Fearing§0 the worst, the researchers addressed the subjects via the intercom.
Page 8: We are opening the chamber to test the microphones," they said. "Step away from the door and lie flat on the floor or you will be shot. Compliance will earn one of you your immediate freedom."A voice from inside answered, We no longer want to be freed."
Page 9: Two more days passed without contact of any kind as the scientists debated what to do next. Finally, they decided to terminate the experiment.
Page 10: At midnight on the fifteenth day the stimulant gas was flushed from the chamber and replaced with fresh air in preparation for the subjects' release.
Page 11: Far from being pleased at the prospect of leaving the chamber, the subjects began screaming as if in fear for their §0lives.They§0 begged to have the gas turned back on. Instead,the researchers unsealed the door to the
Page 12: chamber and sent armed soldiers inside to retrieve them. Nothing could have prepared them for the carnage they witnessed upon entering. One subject was found dead, lying face-down in sixinches of bloody water. Chunks of his
Page 13: flesh had been torn off and stuffed into the floor drain. All of the test subjects were found to have been severely mutilated, in fact. What's worse, the wounds appeared to be self-inflicted.
Page 14: They had ripped open their own abdomens and disemboweled themselves with their bare hands. Some had even eaten their own flesh. The four who were still alive seemed terrified of falling asleep and refused to leave the chamber, again pleading
Page 15: with the researchers to turn the gas back on. When the soldiers attempted to remove the inmates by force, they fought back so ferociously they couldn't believe their eyes. One suffered a ruptured spleen and lost so much blood 
Page 16: there was literally nothing left for his heart to pump, yet continued flailing for a full three minutes until his lifeless body collapsed. The remaining subjects were restrained and transported to a medical facility for treatment. 
Page 17: The first to be operated on fought so furiously against being anesthetized that he tore muscles and broke bones during the struggle. As soon as the anesthetic took effect his heart stopped and he died. The rest underwent surgery without sedation.
Page 18: Far from feeling any pain, however, they laughed hysterically on the operating table -- so hysterically that the doctors, perhaps fearing for their own sanity, administered a paralytic agent to immobilize them. After surgery the survivors were asked why 
Page 19: they had mutilated themselves, and why they so desperately wanted to go back on the stimulant gas. Each, in turn, gave the same answer: "I must remain awake."The researchers considered euthanizing them to obliterate every trace of the failed 
Page 20: experiment, but were overruled by their commanding officer, who ordered that it be resumed immediately, with three of the researchers joining the inmates in the sealed chamber. Horrified at the prospect, 
Page 21: the chief researcher pulled out a pistol and shot the commanding officer point blank. He then turned and shot one of the two surviving subjects. Pointing his gun at the last one left alive, he asked, What are you? I must know!"
Page 22: "Have you forgotten so easily?" the subject said, smiling. We are you. We are the madness that lurks within you all, begging to be free at every moment in your deepest animal mind. We are what you hide from in your beds every night.
Page 23: We are what you sedate into silence and paralysis when you go to the nocturnal haven where we cannot tread."
Page 24: The researcher fired a bullet into his heart. The EEG monitor flatlined as the subject murmured these last words: "§0So...nearly...free."§0

Page 4:      Introduction
=================== Welcome to potion brewing! If you're new, keep in mind that you need a brewing stand, glass bottles filled with water, and many ingredients, which vary depending on what type of potion you may want to create.
Page 5:      Introduction
=================== Every brewing stand has the capability to hold at maximum three bottles at a time, meaning you can make 3 potions for every single ingredient you add. Keep this in mind!
Page 6:   Base Ingredients
=================== These ingredients start all potions.
------------------- ?Nether Wart
?Glowstone Dust
?Redstone
?Fermented Spider Eye [Adding these to a water bottle will create a base potion. see page 11]
Page 7: Secondary Ingredients =================== ?Magma Creme
?Sugar
?Glistering Melon
?Spider Eye
?Ghast Tear
?Blaze Powder
?Fermented Spider Eye
?Golden Carrot
?Pufferfish
?Rabit's Foot
Page 8:         Modifiers
=================== Add these to a potion to alter their effects. -------------------?Redstone
[Increases duration]
?Glowstone Dust
[Increases potency]
?Gunpowder
[Turns into a splash]
?Fermented Spider Eye
[See next page]
Page 9:   Effect Corruption
=================== Fermented Spider Eyes will change a potion's base effect, often reversing it or producing a negative potion. A "corrupted" potion usually does the opposite of the original potion.
Page 10:       Base Potions
=================== Base potions, much like base ingredients, are the basis of all potions. These are the potions created by simply a watter bottle and a base ingredient together.
Page 11:    Awkward Potion

       Base of:
-------------------?Healing      ?Fire Res.

Page 14:     Effect Potions
===================Effect Potions are any potion that can be used to add any sort of effect onto a player. There are both positive and negative effect potions, both of which can give advantages in combat, or even in building or mining.
Page 15:    Positive Potions
=================== When used, these potions will apply a positive effect to the player.       POTION OF: ?Healing
?Fire Resistance
?Regeneration

From: Mr.Ozias

- Ex Bully victim

(Note: After our conversation the other day I decided to write this. Hope it helps, even alittle is enough.)
Page 1: To the girls whos name I don't know, iv heard of your troubles at school and I hope these few words can help. I wished there had been someone to tell me what I want to tell you, but my experiences with bullies was different. So many days I spent alone,
Page 2: wondering why it had to be me, why they wouldn't just leave me alone. All I wanted was for it to end, so I could be happy. For the longest time it was like this for me and never once did I tell anyone, an I wish I had. Back then as a kid I thought that no
Page 3: one could help, or that no one would understand. Looking back now I can tell you... I was wrong. I realize I was not the only one, and even more so.. that I was not alone. If there is anything I want you to take from this its that your not alone in this 
Page 4: fight. Its unfair that you have had to face this so young in life, because if you know it yet or not, you have a lot of happiness ahead of you, more then you could ever know. Through every storm there is always a beautiful rainbow that follows. An I can 
Page 5: tell you now when this storm does pass, you will see the rainbow too. I know it doesn't seem like it sometimes, but you will get through this. Your mum loves you, I know that by just talking to her, and in the end all you need is that love to give you the
Page 6: strength to go on. You are strong and I know already that you are beautiful without even seeing you. Never let people make you think otherwise, don't let people make you think your not worth it. You are worth it, and I want you to remember that your are 
Page 7: not alone, I have been too and I have seen the blue sky and the sun after the storm, and it was because I did not give up. Let the bullies know that you won't give up, let them know that you won't be beaten by them, let them know you are worth it. The one
Page 8: true way to beat a bully is to show them that you are beautiful and you will be beautiful even after the storm. I want to share my strength through these words, so that you know you can do it. Never give up, be determined to beat this, and I promise you 
Page 9: that you will make it through this. Keep your mum close, because she will always be in your corner and fight for you tooth and nail. Never lose your smile. An most of all never give up.

-Mr.Ozias

The strength to never give up.

	Title: Cow's Tale: Ch1
	Author: XxChaosIncxX
	Type: Written

Page 0: §9Prologue:

§0Despite the downpour,
Chaos boldy ventured
on into the woeful
valley of
blackened elms.

The sopping sounds of
his splashing feet
echoed into the still,
rain-drenched woods.
Page 1: The burdens he bore
were great, not only
those on his
back, but those of the
heavy toll of sin on
his soul.

Everyone. Not a single
peasant spared. He
mused over his
decision to kill
everyone that looked
like the damned.
Page 2: "Perhaps my judgement
was too harsh. Yes,
that woman really
meant no harm."

He chuckled in
remembrance of the
mass slaughter in the
peaceful hamlet.
Chaos was a hearty
paladin-cow.
Page 3: He didn't stop to think
as he systematically
purged the entire
town.
Penance must be paid

He was on a spiritual
quest to cleanse his
sins he had done in
the company of the
alluring man mage,
Zhalfir.
Page 4: §6Chapter 1

§5-Seven weeks ago, the
hour of the
tendercrisp bacon elf
sandwich.
Page 5: Leaning on the
banister of the
dwarven trade ship,
Chaos saw the Mage's
mighty tower from at
least three fortnight's
walks.

The knight-errant
Chaos had recieved an
ultimatum from the
Dwarven Council.
Page 6: The council were the
rulers of the kingdom
Stoutschmeckle.

Chaos was a simple
man-cow; a mercenary
with a fancy title, and
was by far no means
a hero. He sported a
draping moustache, his
bedraggled hair the
typical burly brown of
his highland homeland.
Page 7: His armor was of
modest leather and
iron, and by chance an
unadorned steel cap
sat atop his head.

No true knight was he.

His equipment
consisted of a sturdy
black mace and a
round shield adorned
with a blue spiral.
Page 8: An ample sack covered
his cape, full of
whimsical odds and
ends necessary for
survival in the world in
which he resided.

The nights were long
and the days were hot,
but in time the sea
voyage met its end.
Page 9: Upon arrival, Chaos
strolled off of the
gangway and onto
solid ground.

The wind whipped up
from the grey ocean
as he beheld the
impressive edifice in
its full glory.
Page 10: Grim clouds slowly
whirled about the top
of the looming
structure, as if by
some...magical force,
perhaps.

He trundled toward
the base of the tower,
and shambled up the
incline to the
entrance.
Page 11: Chaos paused upon
the last step on the
top of the cascading
stairway that led to a
somber, shale door
set in the base of the
stupendous monolith.

A feeling of doubt
washed over him,
quickly being shook
away, knowing he must
press on.
Page 12: He forged his iron will
anew into steel and
reached for the goblin
shaped knocker on the
left of a similar, troll
headed one. 

He recoiled in horror
when the statue's
eyes rolled about
madly.
Page 13: "Wahts we got here
Elliott?" the sentient
copper goblin giggled.

"I thinks its fresh
meat for the master."
squealed Elliott the
troll head.
Page 14: Shat-tap, bitch. You
sound like a shrieking
milkmaid who's just
seen a barewolf!
Page 15: "Oh, certainly," replied
the goblin. "But we are
only here to forewarn
the supple fools who
Master lures in.
Secure your ass
plate, noble knight! For
Master desires
manflesh more than
anything these days.

But business is
business, so says I.
Page 16: So enter, but 
remember us well.

For we are the only
pair of knockers you'll
ever see in this tower!
Hee Hee!"

The two copper beings
parted to the sides as
the gates swung
open.
Page 17: Chaos set forth in
determination. He
passed through the
foreboding entrance
and came upon a
crossroads.

Three halls diverged,
marked by troubling,
leering gargoyles. The
left probed deep into
the innermost clutches
of the burly ground.
Page 18: The one ahead
consisted of a
seemingly endless
hallway. The rightmost
path led up a
mesmerizing staircase.

Chaos' keen snout
sensed a moist wind
emanating from the
spiral staircase.
Page 19: Knowing that the
master wizard. Zhalfir
could only exist in a
solid state in sopping
climes, he turned and
began to ascend the
staircase.
Page 20: "Ware the seductions
of Master," the goblin
echoed from behind.
"Even the straightest
arrow can be bent!"

After the warning,
Elliott let loose a
squeal that sounded a
little bit like a fire
hose sprayed through
an electric fan filled
with pelicans and -
Page 21: whistling track
coaches who had a
little too much time on
their hands and liked
to play tug of war
behind the snack
shack but one day the
tennis kids came by
and tipped it over,
subsequently trapping
them in the tomblike
waste wallow and he
hated his life
Page 22: and all the days after
no one looked at him
quite the same way, not
even his family and
that's what Elliott's
scream sounded like.

Chaos ventured
deeper into the
labyrinthine halls. As
he progressed, he
began to fall into
a dreamlike state.
Page 23: The winding corridors
seemed to shift as
inexplicable enigmas
danced within his
primitive manbrain.

His rhythmic footsteps
were punctuated by
mysterious sounds;
sudden soft laughter,
or the quiet shutting
of a door.
Page 24: He felt a singular
sense of disquiet as
he strode ever
quicker down the
corridor, fighting the
trancelike waves of
unreality.

He was suddenly
aware of a vast
presence behind him,
and he whirled
around.
Page 25: Shield set and mace
drawn back, but
nothing was there, and
Chaos began to doubt
his own sanity.

§7(Certainly it wasn't
there in the first
place because he kills
a shit load of innocent
people.)
Page 26: Then a notion arose.
Perhaps Chaos was
not really wandering
the halls, not even
moving. Gods! 

He was wandering
within his own mind! He
must get back to
consciousness right
now, lest he wake up
with a sore ass.
Page 27: He struggled through
the blurring mire of
the dreamworld, trying
to reach out for
consciousness.

Finally, with all of his
will, he snapped back
awake, and found
himself in a dim, velvet
room.
Page 28: His armor covered in
rose petals, but
thankfully still on.

Page 4:      Introduction
=================== Welcome to potion brewing! If you're new, keep in mind that you need a brewing stand, glass bottles filled with water, and many ingredients, which vary depending on what type of potion you may want to create.
Page 5:      Introduction
=================== Every brewing stand has the capability to hold at maximum three bottles at a time, meaning you can make 3 potions for every single ingredient you add. Keep this in mind!
Page 6:   Base Ingredients
=================== These ingredients start all potions.
------------------- ?Nether Wart
?Glowstone Dust
?Redstone
?Fermented Spider Eye [Adding these to a water bottle will create a base potion. see page 11]

Page 34: Minecraft, I WRITE ESSAYS WHILE I PLAY§0
§0
§0The Real essay:§0
§0 I want to be a writer when I grow up. I want to write childrens books and be known with my pen name: Callista Schroeder. I am already working on a short novel. §0
§0 I do feel like it is many 
Page 35: children's dreams to be a writer; many of the kids inside and outside of my school that I know have similar ambitions to my own. In saying that, I do not think that many of my friends will not become writers, but I think that I will try my hardest to make
Page 36: myself a writer. I have already acomplished some things. I was a state finalist in a library of congress essay contest. I wrote to a publisher and asked her some questions. I have had friends and family look at my writing and give me suggestions and I 
Page 37: have taken those tips seriously and made the changes nesesary.  I feel a certain calling when I write, as if I can say anything to anybody, anywhere, in any means and it will come through to them. When I write, I also feel like I can give my characters 
Page 38: whatever life and thoughts I want them to have, from my own dream world to what I hope my friends think of me. §0

§0Thanks for doing renovations on my house, it looks nice.  Oh, and the reason I had extra fences is because the slimes would fall off of the blocks and die.  And, yes, that room was yours. I added your name to the chests, and the dorm.

§0The reason I removed all the stuff here is because it was getting greifed multipul times a week and the mods where getting a little annoyed repairing it, when i stoped playing for a while, about a month, I came back to find
Page 1: Everything taken, spawners, iron, the lot.§0
§0
§0I was able to get the iron back, but the spawners logs where to far back to be retrived, I have the iron in a chest at my new house, every last bit of it.§0

§0I was over at Pumpkin7 trying to find some Lapis earlier and noticed that ALL the pig spawners, iron and stuff were gone.§0
§0Plus, all ap's privated chests were now owned by you.

§0LeafCloak came to help and confirmed that you had done it.§0
§0I'm very disappointed because we had an agreement.§0

§0
§0We agreed that we would completely leave ap's things alone in case he was unbanned. I never remember us saying that it was okay to take his stuff for our own.
Page 3: I have a small favour:§0
§0Please put all the things to took back to where they were.§0
§01. The pile of pig spawners in the grinder.§0
§02. ALL the iron from both beacon rooms.§0
§03. The pig and cow spawners from the field.

Page 0:       The URUs§0
§0
§0The URU is one of the rarest types of horse. The URU means: Ultra Rare Undead§0
§0or their full name:§0
§0The Ultra Rare Undead/Zombie Horse, shortened it would be the TURUZH, but that's a bit of a long name.
Page 1: At my farm... oh, I never told you my name! My name is WolfGirl1901, or Wolf for short.§0
§0I own Axe14/Vale15 horse stud, where I breed, sell, buy and rescue all kinds of horses!§0
§0So, at my farm, I'm selling URUs. Just keep in mind that
Page 2: the URUs are the most rare horse in Mutts. At the minute, there are only four of these horses that exist. I own two of them, my friend owns one and another friend owns another.§0
§0I am selling these horses for 25k each. If you are good with§0
§0animals and
Page 3: horses, I may cheapen the price for you!§0
§0If you have another rare horse, like one with a huge amount of hearts, a huge jump high or that goes really fast. I will halve price to 12,5k. That's if you will give me that horse; or the offspring of that horse.
Page 4: Regular horses: 75 mums each§0
§0Race horses: 125 mums each§0
§0Showjumping horses: 150 mums each§0
§0Skeleton horses: 200 mums each§0
§0Donkeys: 50 mums each§0
§0Mules: 100 mums each§0
§0Ultra Rare Undeads: 12.5k/25k each
Page 5: If you want us to look after your horse, we will! All you have to do is: Message me (if online) or drop us a message in the donations box at Axe15/Vale15 horse stud. /visit Vale15 or Axe14 and simply follow the signs and torches!
Page 6: We take great care of your horse, will train and even take out for frequent rides (if wanted).§0
§0Keep in mind that you don't have to give us permition to ride your horse.§0
§0Here is the time/payment times below!
Page 7: 1 day: 25 mums§0
§01 week: 75 mums§0
§01 month: 200 mums§0
§06 months: 400 mums§0
§01 year: 1500 mum§0
§0So basically 25 mums per day, I will be counting how many days your horse stays with us, and when you come and collect it, I will add up the days and tell
Page 8: you the bill!§0
§0
§0Thank you very much for reading this short article about WolfGirl1901's Axe14/Vale15 horse stud.§0
§0
§0Please re-sell this book for 150 mums!

Page 0: Dear Snorelax.§0
§0We have an emergency at Sanford!§0
§0Last night we were griefed. Someone came to the village and KILLED every single animal here.§0
§0Only your one sheep and my Clucksworthy survived. Your sheep was Dublin the lime sheep.
Page 1: The griefer went right through the village going in and out of every house. They also left the doors open.§0
§0I, not thinking anything of the doors, kept shutting them.§0
§0However, I did leave a few open for the mods.
Page 2: The Police Station's pigs have all gone.§0
§0My three sheep are gone.§0
§0All your sheep are gone except Dublin the lime one.§0
§0ALL the cows are missing too.§0
§0I left the EAST Guard Tower's doors for the mods, same with Clementine House's.
Page 3: I just realised, one cow is left. Just one.§0
§0The villager if fine though. Somehow the griefer didn't take the crops, I gather they thought they couldn't be detected.§0
§0I did /modreq and Bates did come. However, logblock doesn't work on things that
Page 4: haven't been placed or damaged, so he couldn't help us.§0
§0We do need to watch out for any more griefs.§0
§0
§0I have hatched a plan to find this griefer.§0
§0I'm going to place an iron block in my yard, if it gets taken I will modreq.
Page 5: But I need to warn all residents of Sanford not to touch it.§0
§0
§0That's all I could do for today unfortunately.§0

I'm such a good detective :P

Anyway, I'll probably not see you today.. your today, not mine.. because I'm out in the evening until 8:50pm, or in your case 9:50pm.

Page 0: WolfGirl1901's Horses:§0
§0
§0       Milky Way§0
§0This was the second horse I ever owned on this server, he is jet-black and very friendly. Spending half his life in fields and open plains, he is very well brought up.§0
§0He is the father of my champion showjumper
Page 1: Flora, who, I will talk about in a minute.§0
§0Milky Way has been to a vast amount of different regions, especially to the one he grew up at; Axe14 wilderness.§0

Page 2:    Moondancer 'Moon'§0
§0
§0This is my trecking horse, he has been to many different regions too, and is one of my oldest.§0
§0He is grey with black dapples on his back, a very handsome boy if I do say so myself!§0
§0He has also fathered many orphaned foals.
Page 3:     Jester 'Jest'§0
§0
§0This is my lovely mule, Jester, he was raised by me and my pack of wolves when his mother died when he was a baby. I don't think he ever really knew who his mother was, but is quite happy to chill out with the wolf pups!
Page 4: Jester is extremely friendly, and will come up for a cuddle if you're nice enough.§0
§0He is fast for a mule because his father was a race horse, but is mainly used for trecking and cuddles!
Page 5:      Flora 'Flo'§0
§0
§0This is my 3 times in a row champion showjumper, Flo. She has won around 13 different competitions, but 3 in a row is her personal best. Her jump hight is a huge 4 and a half blocks!§0
§0She is a cream and white coloured (buckskin).
Page 6: Flo has also had many foals in her time, and is the daughter of Milky Way and Eliza Primrose Wolf, my champion race horse who past away a while ago.
Page 7:      Gizmo 'Giz'§0
§0
§0Gizmo, rescued from an abandoned farm, past away on the 30th of the 11th 2015. He was an amazing horse, always full of life, even when being chased off by other horses. I rescued him from an abandoned farm in Axe14 wilderness,
Page 8: he had a name and was tame, but not owned. I took him, with his friend, to my farm which was not far away from it. He could jump 4 blocks and was a orangey colour, like chestnut.§0
§0
§0Rest In Peace Gizmo§0
§0Died: 30/11/2015
Page 9:  Clementine 'Clem'§0
§0
§0Born a day after Gizmo's death, this mare has a lot to live up to.§0
§0She is super fast, even faster than Eliza, the fastest race horse that lived. She looks nothing like her parents, as she is a beautiful brown colour with white socks.
Page 10:    Ace 'Living Dead'§0
§0
§0Ace is an ultra rare Undead/zombie horse, nobody knows when he died, or how he was dead when her was born, but this young monster, is super cool!§0
§0Ace is the son of Marigold, owned by MonsterStomper.§0
§0He is green and well, dead!
Page 11: Ace is very good friends with MonsterStomper's new Undead named, Flesh. Since Marigold past away, or, we think she did, Flesh has been the new horse in the field.§0

Page 12:    Treasure 'Tea'§0
§0
§0Treasure was found in the survival lobby, along with a load more horses. He has a shining personality and is very loving.§0
§0Tea is black with white spots, unlike his daughter, Clover.

Page 1:               Day 1§0
§0---------------------§0
§0    I just met this world they call minecraft. I decided to log my whole life into this journal. Every memory or event that happens to me will go in here day by day.§0
§0
§0   Today the most wonderful
Page 2: thing happend. I was mining and I found some diamonds! I think I might use them to make a pickaxe so I can start constructing my house.  I want an old style house with a big roof. §0
§0
§0   It is starting to get lonley in this world 
Page 3: I wish I could find a companion.§0
§0
§0 Wow! I was walking home from my mine and I ran into a wolf. I used some bones to tame him, I guess now I won't be so lonley.. I think I will name is Ralph. Yea, me and Ralph sounds good.
Page 4:               Day 2§0
§0----------------------    Today me and ralph went to the pond. We sat there and fished for hours upon hours. I am starting to get better at this thing they call "life". One day I think I could actually do something.§0
§0Meh. Lets just 
Page 5: build for now.§0
§0
§0   I just started the construction of my house. It is a very lonley sad looking house. It seems to have nothing to bring in life. I need shelter so I guess I will have to live with my terrible building skills.
Page 6: I wish I could be like the other people. For some reason I seem to be an outcast in the minecraft community. I don't get it yet, maybe it just takes time. 
Page 7:                Day 3§0
§0----------------------§0
§0   I havn't been on this world very long. But it seems like forever with no friends. I feel lonley again, I have thoughts of quitting but I just don't. I have a feeling something will happen to me. Something bad
Page 8: later but good now. I feel like it will be the biggest adventure of my life. But who am I to think that. I am just another square.§0
§0
§0    I finally touched up my house a little bit. It still looks dark and lonley but I added some flowers to make it look 
Page 9: nicer. Just in case one day I happen to run into another person on this forsaken Earth.§0
§0
§0            Day 4§0
§0---------------------        I decided to ditch the old house and move by a pond. I really wanted to try and feel better. I figured the water could
Page 10: help my depression. Plus me and Ralph love to fish together.§0
§0
§0   For some reason Ralph seems like fishing is a bore. I am starting to get worried because he usually has a blast out here. He runs in the water and gets his long white hair wet
Page 11: and then shakes it off. I find it cute. I wonder if he is sick at all. I wouldn't know. I am just an idiot.§0
§0
§0              Day 5§0
§0----------------------     This very goreous girl joined my world! I am filled with happiness, I have never been this 
Page 12: happy ever in my life! I don't know how to explain the over welming love I have for this person. For some reason It makes me beleive in love at first site! I would try to talk to her but I doubt she would even find me remotely attractive, Im a loner.
Page 13:              Day 6§0
§0----------------------     I finally spoke to her, she seemed like a very nice person. I really like her, I hope someday we can be together in the same house and share the same love for things. The thing I find most attractive about her
Page 14: is her long blonde curly hair with her baby blue eyes. I can't explain it, she reminds me of the brightest diamond and the hottest torch. §0
§0
§0   I just showed her Ralph. I think she really likes him, this will give me a chance to hang out with her and 
Page 15: finally not be sad.§0
§0
§0              Day 7§0
§0----------------------      I finally worked up the nerve to speak a word to her. She said my nervousness was cute. This made me feel good inside. I hope I can capture this feeling forever!
Page 16:     I asked her if she wanted to come over and we can have a picnic under the stars. I am still waiting for a reply, I think she will say yes, but you never know.§0
§0
§0   Two whole hours later which felt like years she finally received my letter.
Page 17:     Yes, I had to send her a letter even though she lives across the street. I was too nervous she would turn me down and I would ruin everything.§0
§0
§0             Day 8§0
§0----------------------   Wr finally went on our first date! I am so happy!
Page 18: I am so in love, she said that she really likes me and she is thinking of marriage. This is so good for, I can finally be a normal "square" in this society of Minecraft.§0
§0
§0               Day 9§0
§0----------------------       Today is a bad day, Ralph has died
Page 19: my first companion of this brutal world. My sadness overwelms me, even though I am happy I am sad. Can anyone explain this!!§0
§0
§0   I miss Ralph so much! I just want to go fishing with him again. I want to see him wave the water off his fur. Ohhhh I miss him
Page 20: this is terrible! I hope you guys reading this in the future can understand my grief.§0
§0
§0   My future wife April is a wise lady, she tells me that everything has a purpose and I will soon find out why he died. I just hope that is soon.
Page 21:               Day 10§0
§0----------------------     Today is our marriage, even though I was just sad I feel nothing now. All I feel is love and passion for my wife April. I hope we can live in our newly  bought mansion by the lake. I think I can move on with
Page 22: my life. I am starting to think I can be happy in life, it seemed like I was always sad. Now I feel happiness.§0
§0
§0   I just held my first sword, I never used to fight mobs. I just ran and ran to shelter, yes you could say I was a weak person but
Page 23: I was afraid of the zombie and the creepers. The things that scare me the most are the skeletons. They are so accurate with their stupid bows and arrows. I started to learn how to use sword because I need to protect my lovely wife. Her life means
Page 24: everything.§0
§0
§0                Day 11§0
§0----------------------     I am panicing right now, I heard recent news of a zombie invasion. They have tooken over all the cities around us! I am scared for my life and everyone I love.
Page 25: my one focus right now is protecting my wife. She is the world and I couldn't live without her. §0
§0
§0   There is no keeping tracks of the days anymore. We have sat in this house closet  for I don't know how many days. I don't have the
Page 26: mental copacity to keep track of the days right now. I am going insane! The constant threat of zombies around our house. I am starting to think out defenses are getting weak. This house was built to live in not to withhold a zombie invasion!
Page 27:    We are both scared, My wife is shaking in my arms, I have no idea what to do. I can't fight the zombies there is more than 1,000 outside, they would just take my life and love from my wife.§0
§0
§0    I think it has been 9-10 hours since my last journal 
Page 28: entry. I don't know what day it is, all I know is we are going to die. I hope we can die in each others arms so death can come get us together.§0
§0
§0THERE IN THERE IN I CAN'T DO ANYTHING APRIL APRIL! SHE IS BEING DRAGGED
Page 29: THE ZOMBIES HAVE HER. I AM SORRY MY LOVE. I AM HIDING IN A CLOSET SCARED FOR MY LIFE. I WILL COME FOR YOU!§0
§0
§0   She has been gone, it feels like weeks, months or years! I don't know! All I know is I am coming for her.
Page 30:    I started training today. I am training to be a master at fighting these horrible beast. They will pay for what they did. None of them will live, all will die at the end of my sword. Their blood will spill everywhere. Their lives is the payment
Page 31: for taking my love.§0
§0
§0    I have been training for what feels like 10 days straight. I complete excercises like swinging my sword and kicking hay bails. I am gaining strength, I havn't ate all day I am running of pure adrenaline.
Page 32:    I am starting my journey, I will find my love, I will kill every beast that walks in my way. THIS DAY MARKS A CHANGE IN THE WORLD.§0
§0
§0   She was right, I have a purpose and I have found it. To save her.
Page 33:    I finally have stepped outside the doors. I will not be writing for awhile, I will be slaying and cutting the heads off these beast.§0
§0
§0  I managed to find a hiding spot to sleep tonight. I am in a tree, a birch tree to be exact. This feels like a safe 
Page 34: place to rest. No hiding only rest, I will wake up as early as possible find some food to ration and be on my way.§0
§0
§0   I am stuck on a roof surrounded by zombies. There is no way I can survive. I have to stay here until the zombies think I am gone.
Page 35:     It is the middle of the night, I just had the wildest dream ever. April came to me in my dream and spoke to me. All she said was a riddle. "A place to chase, and have a happy face". §0
§0
§0   THAT'S IT! I KNOW THE ANSWER TO THE RIDDLE!
Page 36: I used to take Ralph to the park and chase him. Playing with made me smile. She is hinting for me to come to the park. I know it! She is there! Oh thank you god! THANK YOU!§0
§0
§0  It is an hour walk to park, I set out at night so I could try and sneak past 
Page 37: the beast. I grabbed one torch to help guide me through the night.§0
§0
§0    UH OH! I have made a mistake I am trapped in a bathroom being swarmed by zombies. I cannot do anything. Please god help me! HELP! 
Page 38:     My eyes went black, all I saw was green faces and a brutal world. I saw the light, someone spoke to me, someone I didn't know. They said " You can do it ". After that I felt a pull, almost like being pulled back down to earth. I woke up and jolted! I
Page 39: somehow was alive and ok. Maybe it was a dream, just maybe. I continued to the park, it was still pitch black and I had lost my torch for the night. I was working of pure instinct. I finally made it. There she WAS APRIL WAS THERE!§0
§0I AM FILL WITH JOY!
Page 40:    I ran up to her, I tried to hug her and say " I love you ". But when she turned I saw her real form. They had turned her. She was one with the beast. I didn't know what to do. I knew I had to the right thing. My love and I...........
Page 41:     I kneeled her down and confessed my love.§0
§0
§0Raised my sword§0
§0
§0And Cutt her head off.§0
§0
§0It was the end§0
§0
§0Nothing§0
§0
§0Just nothing.
Page 42:   I sat there, saw the beast coming. I held my love in my arms, sat there and just thought about our lives.§0
§0
§0   Now I am sitting here in my old house. Writing the rest of this diary.§0
§0
§0I want to end this
Page 43: I want you guys to know what happens to me and to the world.§0
§0
§0The zombie invasion has gotten worse. I have decided that I will do the best thing for me and the world.
Page 44: I was never any good anyway. This was the sign. I know this is what I have to do.§0

§0    This week in the muttsworld community§0
§0we had reports of chickens randomly spawning on players. This occurance has caused question in how the world of minecraft really works.
Page 2:      In further news, Ekip publishing has dominated the market with two popular novels -- "The Name Steve" & "Black Marsh". They have recently announced the publishing of more novels and learning books.
Page 3:     We have had reports of mass vote spam. I guess this is the hype for the server. I would suggest to go vote and support its cause.§0

Page 12: I don't remember anything about the journey or how I got there. I was §0
§0shoved onto a hard concrete surface and could hear a man shouting and §0
§0cursing me.I don't remember anything, but seeing the vicious intent §0
§0in his eyes, and then, my life went black
Page 13: About an hour after, I §0
§0opened my eyes to the world again. All I could see was complete black, §0
§0though a stream of light shone through the material tied around my §0
§0eyes.
Page 14: The first thing I noticed was that my knees were throbbing §0
§0violently. I tried to undo the blindfold, only to realise that my §0
§0hands had been bound together behind my back, the rope cutting sharply §0
§0into my skin. 
Page 15: I struggled aggressively on the hard, stony, unforgiving §0
§0floor, but to no avail. I heard footsteps coming towards me, and a §0
§0man, talking to someone in another language that I could not §0
§0comprehend.
Page 16: I noticed his aggressive tone of voice - it sounded oddly §0
§0familiar. As he came nearer and nearer, and his voice got louder and §0
§0louder, I recognised it as the voice of the man who had attacked me.
Page 17:  I §0
§0felt icy cold hands over my face, as this being leant over to undo my §0
§0blindfold. For a few moments after he took the material away from my §0
§0eyes, I was sure that I was blind.
Page 18: I could see nothing but an §0
§0extremely bright light shining and strange bubbles that floated around §0
§0blocking my vision. After this, my eyes began to focus and my §0
§0whereabouts were slowly revealed to me.
Page 19: I looked up at this man who §0
§0was looking down at me, with big, vicious eyes that seemed ready to §0
§0attack me. He was scruffy looking - quite long shaggy hair, a shabby §0
§0beard, and clothes that had not been washed for weeks.
Page 20:  He wore light §0
§0brown coloured sandals that looked as though they had been handed down §0
§0from his father and worn for generations before him.§0

Page 21: He muttered §0
§0something under his breath, and walked off, leaving me in this strange §0
§0room - or cell, I was not sure. I tried to get up, only to watch my §0
§0legs fail me before my eyes, and I collapsed.
Page 22: At this point, I looked §0
§0down at my knees, to see the blood streaming down. The pain seemed to §0
§0worsen as I saw the full extent of the damage. I hauled myself up, §0
§0using the bars on the window.
Page 23: They felt strangely cold and smooth - §0
§0just like metal, and it was at that point, that I realised the how §0
§0intense the heat was. I looked between the metal bars, and saw §0
§0something that made me gasp.

	Title: The Creature
	Author: TheBatKid100
	Type: Written

Page 0: §0      The night was young as I started the long journey home from the mineshaft. Today, like most days wasn`t so bad. I stack of iron and finally some gold meant that i could make that gold horse armour for Shelia. I was on my way home when I heard a 

Page 1: §0sound in the distant.    "FWOARP". I`ve never heard that sound before. I`ll be honest, I haven`t played minecraft for a while, especially on my favorite server, Muttsworld, but i`ve played it enough to know that that sound was pretty rare. I ignored it 
Page 2: §0and continued to trod to my house, at a faster pace though.

I was so happy when I finally got home. It was beginning to rain anyway. I put the iron and gold in seperate furnaces and ate some baked potatoes. "FWOARP"! I stopped eating and bolted to 
Page 3: §0the downstairs enchantment room where I heard the sound. "What the hell is that". I looked around and saw nothing. Nothing but some purple particles in the air.

I started to cringe. I just found out what was following me. It`s in my opinion one of the 
Page 4: §0scariest mobs in minecraft, and now it was taking residence in my own home. I went to the chest room and looked for my iron sword. I had no choice but to hunt before I became the hunted. If only I had some pumpkins.

I looked in the market listing for 
Page 5: §0anyone selling some pumpkins but there was none. This only made me more scared as I went back upstairs. I took the iron out of the furnace and made some armour. I was protected, yet the creature still had the element of suprise and fear on its side.
Page 6: §0"If only I had made the headroom for my house smaller, maybe then It wouldn`t be able to get in". I checked the bedrooms of my house, then the bathrooms. It was nowhere to be seen. I knew it was here though because I could still hear the "FWOARP" sounds.
Page 7: §0I decided to check the last place in the house. Shelia`s stable. I was hesitant at first, since Shelia`s stable was at the lowest part of the house, but I had no choice. I stepped down the stairs and opened the door. Shelia looked me directly in the eyes
Page 8: §0At least that`s what I thought, since I didn`t realize that she was actually looking behind me. I turned around and saw purple particles everywhere. The creature`s mouth opened wide as he let out a high pitched shriek. I was scared to look at it, I start
Page 9: §0swinging like crazy. I heard the sound of death so I opened my eyes with joy. Only to see the saddle item drop on the floor. The creature was nowhere to be seen.

I deduced that it left because the rain had just finished. I Made a grave in the backyard o
Page 10: §0the house and placed the saddle inside of it. To this day I am no longer scared of that Creature or any others like it. In fact, I made a vow to take it down if it was the last thing I would do.
Page 11: §0Made by,

Completely original and made on the spot. Hope you enjoyed!

Page 0: §0§0This is the Deadly and Tragic tale of Mr. Whiskers The Cat of Death.
Page 1: §0§0A Man walked through a forest alone with a bottle of vodka. He was quite into it too so he was very drunk as he stumbled over rocks and sticks. As he continued to struggle through the forest he heard a odd and loud Meow in the distance.
Page 2: §0§0As he continued towards the annoying noise it kept geting louder and more odd sounding. Until he discovered a kitten sitting in a pile of sticks. The kitten was mostly black fur although their was some diffrent colors around his legs.
Page 3: §0§0The kitten stared at the man it had also stopped meowing entirely. Drunk as he was the man still remembered how much he hated cats so he continued to throw sevrel sticks and rocks on top of it thinking the kitten could never escape and would die slowly
Page 4: §0§0The man laughed to himself for a good minute before he dropped his bottle. He quickly retrieved it of course but to his suprise when he looked up the kitten was there stareing at him. This confused the man because he was sure he trapped the kitten earl
Page 5: §0§0The man cursed at the kitten in rage of how stupid he felt at the moment. The cat then said to the mans suprise. "Such a lovely set of words you have said. please continue" The man quickly screamed and fell backwords.
Page 6: §0§0To the mans suprise the kitten was on his chest within seconds looking into his eyes. while peering into them the man couldnt help but feel fear as he heard whispers all around him and throughout the forest. The cat continued to stare without speaking.
Page 7: §0§0The Man came to his senses soon and tried to get up only to find he lacked the strength as the kitten dug its claws into him and said. "No no §0no...not§0 so §0fast...you§0 and me have a few things to discuss." 
Page 8: §0§0The Man struggled much more feeling the claws begin to burn into his skin as the kitten spoke. "You think you can just kill a innocent cat in the woods and that nobody would miss §0it....its§0 just another pointless animal to you."
Page 9: §0§0"You think that i wouldnt have survived §0that.....well§0 sir...a word from the §0wise....when§0 you try to kill §0something........make§0 sure its really dead" The Man then felt only cold as his vision faded and the kitten soon walked away satisfied w
Page 10: §0§0"Oh and §0sir.....do§0 me a favor and tell them Mr. Whiskers sent you. They will have a good laugh at that"
Page 11: §0§0Nobody has seen the kitten sense then. but in the forest there are still some tiny §0pawprints....and§0 the occasional dead §0body....flayed§0 and §0mutilated....left§0 to §0rot..with§0 claw marks at its chest and claw and teeth marks on their throat.

      Muttsworld
         Story



by Sammich98
Page 1:    Once upon a time,
there was a beautiful princess named Sammich. She was only a beautiful princess because her skin was Princess Daisy.
  She had discovered Muttsworld after some time of single player minecraft and played for a while in solitude and 
Page 2: silence. At some point, she got a boyfriend by the name of "mrawesome12345" or something of the likes. Then, after Minecraft dating him for a while he got banned, because his "brother" griefed. She still visited his house at /spawn 4 until it was no 
Page 3: longer a command and she was too lazy to walk from there. Sometime between then and now, she got active in the chat and was very helpful to the many, many noobs of Muttsworld. It was about 5 or 6 months of playing, and she made a staff application to be 
Page 4: an ambassador. That was when only mods and admins could reply to applications and anyone could reply to ban appeals. Sammich got quite positive feedback on the app, with +0.5s and +1s.
  Then.... after a month of the application being there with
Page 5: nothing but positive reviews, she logged on to Muttsworld and a friend said something to her in chat.
"huh?" was about what her reply was.
Then, the realization sunk in. She was an ambassador.



Page 6: Skip forward to April 2013, where she didn't play Minecraft for a month or so and got demoted. She basically didn't play much for a while, until the fall of 2013, when she got re-promoted to ambassador. So then, she played Muttsworld lots and lots
Page 7: as an ambassador, until one day...

Mumblerit needed a shower, but no mods were on to handle modreqs.
"who wants to be a mod?" he had asked
A cry of "me!" was seen in diplochat.
Page 8: "lol" was all the beautiful Princess Sammich said.
"ah, sammich. perfect" was about what mumblerit had said.
So, she was a mod.
  Then, that brings us to where we are now (well, where Sammich is now as she is writing this), which is Sammich floating
Page 9: in the sky at /spawn.


THE END

Page 0: §0    Legend of the
   Moon and Stars
       Chapter 1
Now once upon a time within the realm of the Cloud realm there was great peace and happiness upon the gods that lived there.
The queen and king of the Cloud Realm had two sons, Arthaheart the youngest,
Page 1: §0and Mundiken (originally Aurelius) the oldest brother.
Now no one was brave enough to venture into the Space Realm, an empty black void of pure nothingness and a portal of inky realms unlit and unexplored.
Now queen and king of the Cloud Realm were 
Page 2: §0curious and went into this black void called the Space Realm. Now when they went they had unfortunately never returned. Some say that they had vanished, a beast had ate them whole, they had been killed by the unknown, or worse got lost in the endless

Page 3: §0darkness. No one knew where they had vanished but chaos began to erupt between the gods. The queen and king had forgotten to appoint one of their sons heir to the throne to rule the great and mighty Cloud Realm.



Page 4: §0      Chapter 2
As said chaos and anger erupted. The gods panicked. They had no ruler and were scared for their Cloud Realm's fate.
They were calmed down once Arthaheart and Mundiken announced that there would be a king.
However Mundiken and Arthaheart
Page 5: §0had never known how they would settle this.
The brothers loved each other dearly but they slowly began to worry with each passing day with no king.
Now the brothers watched upon the mortals below their beloved Cloud Realm and saw how they fought and
Page 6: §0killed to become king.
Now Arthaheart and Mundiken grimaced at the mortals ways to become a king.
The brothers love for each other was beginning to weaken. Both of them were ready for either to make their move to the throne.
They wondered when one of the
Page 7: §0would announce who they would want to rule.
Alas, time passed and the gods became impatient with the decision that had not yet been made.
The brothers began to fear each other. They had many fights.
          
Page 8: §0        Chapter 3
Now the brothers fought viciously and many of the gods traveled to stop them yet the brothers charged.
The clouds blew away revealing the dark night void of sky above.
Now Arthaheart an Mundiken on the impact of the charge 
Page 9: §0caused the gods to blow to bits and pieces of glowing dust that blew into space.
Now the enraged Mundiken had killed and turned his brother Arthaheart into bits and pieces.
Going mad he went unto the mortals to take his horrible wrath upon them! Now the 
Page 10: §0gods saw this and formed an impenetrable cage around Mundiken.
Not only that but this became the moon. The other gods however that had died...their remains floated into space and then turned into glowig bits and pieces that became stars.

Page 11: §0However the real legend was this....
The moon that held Mundiken captive had even though powerful to keep him inside Mundiken could move it.
The moon rotates around the world of mortals because Mundiken searches for Arthaheart's remains believing to take
Page 12: §0control of the Cloud Realm throne.
However the stars filled the stars to comfort the mortals that Mundiken would never be unleashed and destroy them all.
In the end though this story was sadly forgotten. It lives in this very book. It lives as the Legend

     How To Enchant


An Enchanting Guide by: KittyPuppy123

Page 2:   Chapter 1
         Recipes

Welcome! This book is a guide on how to enchant! First thing you're gonna need is an Enchantment Table or an Anvil. To enchant on an Anvil, you need Enchanted Books which can be found or enchanted. Books can
Page 3: be enchanted to make Enchanted Books on an Enchantment Table. To make an Enchantment Table, you need 4 Obsidian, 2 Diamonds, and 1 Book. To make an Anvil, you need 3 Iron Blocks and 4 Iron Ingots.
Page 4:    Chapter 2
         How To Enchant 
When you enchant an item, (Sword, Bow, or an Armor Piece.) put it in the slot that has a grayish picture of an Armor Piece and a Sword. Then, you need levels. Experience is dropped by mobs, except for Villagers. Every
Page 5: animal drops about the same Experience orbs. I believe Endermen or Iron Golems drop the most, not including The Ender Dragon, dropping 1200 Exp Points. Maybe even 12000, but I am unsure. Click on one of the Green Number things in a tannish rectangle, and
Page 6: it will come up with a random enchantment. Now, if you're very lucky, you may get like Sharpness IV.
Page 7:    Chapter 3
        Anvils.

As I have explained, you're gonna need Enchanted Books for Anvils. Put what you would like to enchant in the first slot, then the Enchanted Book in the second slot. In the third slot, will come out your enchanted item. 
Page 8: But, you need levels to enchant it. You can also rename your item, with a cost of about 5 levels, but it depends if the item is rare or not. The least levels to rename your item is about 5. You can also repair items by putting 2 together, but this costs
Page 9: levels too. Now, you can't mix a Diamond Pickaxe with an Iron Pickaxe. For example, your Diamond Pickaxe is almost about to break. You try to mix it with a Wooden Pickaxe, that won't work. Say if your Golden Helmet is about to die. Mix it with another
Page 10: Golden Helmet, to repair it.

Page 0: Diary of a CASTLEBUILDER!

Day One

It has been very hard. I have already bought all of the sand on the market to use for glass... The floor isn't even HALF DONE!
Page 1: Day Two

Still no sand on the market... And nobody has ten stacks to sell me either. I met a new guy called wario355. He was very useful...
Page 2: Day Three

This is getting interesting, i have found sand and wario355 seems to be trying to get close as if it's some kind of trap...
Page 3: Day Four

As I sit here writing this book, I realise the sand still hasn't cooked... WHAT SORCERY IS THIS!? I do think I may be going crazy...
WHAT IS HAPPENING!?
Although i haven't finished the floor yet, I do quite believe that it shall be finished...
Page 4: Day 4 (Pt. 2)

I am collecting the sand from the furnaces, I don't think i have enough... Only 6 stacks... BAH! Who am I kidding... LET'S DO THIS! Or maybe I should wait until the night is over...


Page 5: Day 4 (Pt. 3)

Now the night is over, I shall finish my castle floor! Yes, I am still on the floor... WOAH! Nearly fell today, and I may have misplaced one glass block, but that does not matter-
Page 6: Ending

-For i have finished!
(Well, at least the floor)

It is time to say farewell, look out for Vol. 2 in a few days, weeks, maybe months, if I get round to it, that is.

	Title: The Creature
	Author: TheBatKid100
	Type: Written

Page 0: §0      The night was young as I started the long journey home from the mineshaft. Today, like most days wasn`t so bad. I stack of iron and finally some gold meant that i could make that gold horse armour for Shelia. I was on my way home when I heard a 

Page 1: §0sound in the distant.    "FWOARP". I`ve never heard that sound before. I`ll be honest, I haven`t played minecraft for a while, especially on my favorite server, Muttsworld, but i`ve played it enough to know that that sound was pretty rare. I ignored it 
Page 2: §0and continued to trod to my house, at a faster pace though.

I was so happy when I finally got home. It was beginning to rain anyway. I put the iron and gold in seperate furnaces and ate some baked potatoes. "FWOARP"! I stopped eating and bolted to 
Page 3: §0the downstairs enchantment room where I heard the sound. "What the hell is that". I looked around and saw nothing. Nothing but some purple particles in the air.

I started to cringe. I just found out what was following me. It`s in my opinion one of the 
Page 4: §0scariest mobs in minecraft, and now it was taking residence in my own home. I went to the chest room and looked for my iron sword. I had no choice but to hunt before I became the hunted. If only I had some pumpkins.

I looked in the market listing for 
Page 5: §0anyone selling some pumpkins but there was none. This only made me more scared as I went back upstairs. I took the iron out of the furnace and made some armour. I was protected, yet the creature still had the element of suprise and fear on its side.
Page 6: §0"If only I had made the headroom for my house smaller, maybe then It wouldn`t be able to get in". I checked the bedrooms of my house, then the bathrooms. It was nowhere to be seen. I knew it was here though because I could still hear the "FWOARP" sounds.
Page 7: §0I decided to check the last place in the house. Shelia`s stable. I was hesitant at first, since Shelia`s stable was at the lowest part of the house, but I had no choice. I stepped down the stairs and opened the door. Shelia looked me directly in the eyes
Page 8: §0At least that`s what I thought, since I didn`t realize that she was actually looking behind me. I turned around and saw purple particles everywhere. The creature`s mouth opened wide as he let out a high pitched shriek. I was scared to look at it, I start
Page 9: §0swinging like crazy. I heard the sound of death so I opened my eyes with joy. Only to see the saddle item drop on the floor. The creature was nowhere to be seen.

I deduced that it left because the rain had just finished. I Made a grave in the backyard o
Page 10: §0the house and placed the saddle inside of it. To this day I am no longer scared of that Creature or any others like it. In fact, I made a vow to take it down if it was the last thing I would do.
Page 11: §0Made by,
        TheBatKid100

Completely original and made on the spot. Hope you enjoyed!

Page 0: §0§0John stared out of the window over the houses, each one with a few people, all going about their lives normally, a cool breeze touched his face and he wondered why he couldn't be like them, of course he was sure others had felt this way, it was unlikel
Page 1: §0§0that he was the first, yet he still thought it and wondered how they managed to, to go to parties and generally be socially functioning, normal people, John didn't have many friends, and he had never spoken with anyone about anything of truly great imp
Page 2: §0§0about himself, the house felt more like a prison than a place to live, he couldn't stand it, the energy coursing though his veins, he wanted to go outside and scream at the world until he found someone who was the same, but he never would, he could nev
Page 3: §0§0just abandon the pretense of sanity, yet he continued to feel like an outsider. If John ever spoke to people about the regular trivial things that people so often talk about, it was usually because he was thrust into the situation against his will.
Page 4: §0§0His thoughts raced, neurons firing carrying precious data working on one thousand and one problems that he would probably never work out the solution to before he was hit by it again, the overwhelming sense that it was pointless and that he should just
Page 5: §0§0give up.§0
§0§0He would have sighed, but he didn't make sounds when he was alone, it never seemed right to him, he closed the window and took a spinning jump onto his bed, sprawling himself on the sheets that just seemed rough and uncomfortable,
Page 6: §0§0waiting silently for the maelstrom of his thoughts to calm so he could finally fall asleep.

Page 0:        Sammich's
      Muttsworld
         Story



by Sammich98
Page 1:    Once upon a time,
there was a beautiful princess named Sammich. She was only a beautiful princess because her skin was Princess Daisy.
  She had discovered Muttsworld after some time of single player minecraft and played for a while in solitude and 
Page 2: silence. At some point, she got a boyfriend by the name of "mrawesome12345" or something of the likes. Then, after Minecraft dating him for a while he got banned, because his "brother" griefed. She still visited his house at /spawn 4 until it was no 
Page 3: longer a command and she was too lazy to walk from there. Sometime between then and now, she got active in the chat and was very helpful to the many, many noobs of Muttsworld. It was about 5 or 6 months of playing, and she made a staff application to be 
Page 4: an ambassador. That was when only mods and admins could reply to applications and anyone could reply to ban appeals. Sammich got quite positive feedback on the app, with +0.5s and +1s.
  Then.... after a month of the application being there with
Page 5: nothing but positive reviews, she logged on to Muttsworld and a friend said something to her in chat.
"huh?" was about what her reply was.
Then, the realization sunk in. She was an ambassador.



Page 6: Skip forward to April 2013, where she didn't play Minecraft for a month or so and got demoted. She basically didn't play much for a while, until the fall of 2013, when she got re-promoted to ambassador. So then, she played Muttsworld lots and lots
Page 7: as an ambassador, until one day...

Mumblerit needed a shower, but no mods were on to handle modreqs.
"who wants to be a mod?" he had asked
A cry of "me!" was seen in diplochat.
Page 8: "lol" was all the beautiful Princess Sammich said.
"ah, sammich. perfect" was about what mumblerit had said.
So, she was a mod.
  Then, that brings us to where we are now (well, where Sammich is now as she is writing this), which is Sammich floating
Page 9: in the sky at /spawn.

Page 0: §0§0Nicole waved at the security guard at the building across the street, causing him to give her a puzzled look.§0
§0§0They of course didn't know eachother, it was unsurprising considering as a deadly assassin she rarely befriended
Page 1: §0§0security guards, it would be sort of like a bank robber befriending a cashier.§0
§0§0She walked across the street smiling sweetly, the guard still looking mildly puzzled.§0
§0§0'Hey, it's Bill isn't it?' she said 'We met at that thing last week?'
Page 2: §0§0'I have no idea who you are' he replied in a rather toneless voice. 'Also my name is Steve'§0
§0§0'Right! Steve of course, how could I get you mixed up with Bill!' Nicole smoothly replied.
Page 3: §0§0'My name isn't Steve either, you're either attempting to distract me or bluff your way past me and it's not going to work' he stiffly replied.§0
§0§0'Well it was worth a shot, would you mind holding this for me a second?' 
Page 4: §0§0said Nicole passing him a pink umbrella with a floral design.§0
§0§0The security guard looked amused and accepted the umbrella, which immediately exploded killing him, Nicole stepped over the body and continued into the
Page 5: §0§0building....§0
§0§0The lobby was decorated for Christmas and there were five security guards pointing guns at her and demanding she get on the floor. §0
§0§0They clearly did not mean that she should beam at them and 
Page 6: §0§0sit on the floor cross legged but this is nonetheless what she did, one of the security guards told her such in no uncertain words and when she refused he rather rudely attempted to shoot her.
Page 7: §0§0He did not appear to realise that she had earlier snuck into the security guard's armoury through a ventilation shaft and replaced all of the guard's guns with confetti firing replicas.§0
§0§0After a rather amusing but less than
Page 8: §0§0deadly confetti shower she proceeded to grab a Christmas wreath off a wall and strangle one of the guards with it, she took a few deadly throwing 'Christmas' stars out of her bag and down went the second and third guard.
Page 9: §0§0As the second two bolted she started humming 'Rudolf the red nosed reindeer', triggering the sound activated Santa-shaped bomb she casually lobbed after them.§0
§0§0She proceeded up the elevator to the top floor, the boss sat
Page 10: §0§0in a comfortable ergonomic chair as the humming assassin walked into his office, he immediately pulled a shotgun out from underneath his desk...
Page 11: §0§0Nicole quickly dodged out of the way of the first shot and grabbed some christmas lights off the wall, she did a backflip over the next shot and landed perfectly behind the boss, wrapped the christmas lights around his neck and threw him out
Page 12: §0§0the window.§0
§0§0She whistled as she calmly stepped out of the window and began to absail down the building using the christmas lights, as she passed the boss she gave him a friendly kick. She calmly walked away from the scenes of
Page 13: §0§0destruction and smiled at the firemen and policemen, she grabbed one of them on the arm.§0
§0§0'Hey, you're really cute, stand two feet to the left for a minute'§0
§0§0The fireman bemusedly complied and two seconds later all of the others were
Page 14: §0§0crushed as the top of the building exploded.

The True Origin of

HEROBRINE





-by: axlgx
Page 1: As you might believe, or even know, Herobrine is the believed 'Ghost' of the brother of the creator of Minecraft, A.K.A. Noth. But, is that true? Does he even has a brother?
The answer is yes, he has a borther. But, then what is Herobrine?
Page 2: Pretty simple, it's not a ghost, not a God, and by surprise, it's not a Mob. It's, for my point of view, a prototype of NPC for the most player-like creature.
But well, it didn't went well at all. I think that it was some kind of 'follower' in the...
Page 3: beguinning of Minecraft develop.
But it went rogue and basically did what it does now, even trought it has been 'removed'.
Not a ghost, Not a God. A Rogue NPC, or that's what i think.
Don't trust other Herobrine legends,
Page 4: since most of the people outside lie.
The most important part is what YOU believe. Share your opininon, but don't make it the truth, since it's umpossible to know the truth at all.

Page 0: Farming

There are many different types of farming, the easiest are cocoa farming and nether wart farming.
Cocoa--To farm cocoa, simply place cocoa beans on a jungle wood block, and harvest when the pod turns bright orange. 
Page 1: Then, replant and repeat.
Nether Wart--Place on soul sand and wait until it is about 1 block tall, then destroy it and plant again.
Sugar--Place a sugar cane on sand or dirt next to water, then wait until it is 3 blocks high, then punch the  block high 
Page 2: piece. This should give you 2 more sugar canes. 
Wheat--Carrots-Potatoes--place near water or irrigation system for best results. They need to be harvested when fully grown, then replanted.
Melons--Pumpkins--Place the seed on plowed, irrigated land, but 
Page 3: with a place next to the plant for the melon-or pumpkin to grow. When the plant is gown, detroy it to gain melon slices or a pumpkin (depending on what type of plant it is.).

ANIMAL FARMING--When farming animals, make sure thay cannot
Page 4: move more than 20 blocks in any direction (Except from up or down), otherwise, they'll despawn! Breed them often to get the best results, and remember that everything eats wheat...apart from chickens, which eat seeds.

Page 0: All the world's a stage,
And all the men and women merely players;
They have their exits and their entrances,
And one man in his time plays many parts,
His acts being seven ages. At first, the infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
Page 1: Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
Page 2: Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,
Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation
Page 3: Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
In fair round belly with good capon lined,
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
And so he plays his part.
Page 4: The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;
His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
Page 5: For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
Page 6: That ends this strange eventful history,
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.

	Title: Cow's Tale: Ch1
	Author: XxChaosIncxX
	Type: Written

Page 0: §9Prologue:

§0Despite the downpour,
Chaos boldy ventured
on into the woeful
valley of
blackened elms.

The sopping sounds of
his splashing feet
echoed into the still,
rain-drenched woods.
Page 1: The burdens he bore
were great, not only
those on his
back, but those of the
heavy toll of sin on
his soul.

Everyone. Not a single
peasant spared. He
mused over his
decision to kill
everyone that looked
like the damned.
Page 2: "Perhaps my judgement
was too harsh. Yes,
that woman really
meant no harm."

He chuckled in
remembrance of the
mass slaughter in the
peaceful hamlet.
Chaos was a hearty
paladon-cow.
Page 3: He didn't stop to think
as he systematically
purged the entire
town.
Penance must be paid

He was on a spiritual
quest to cleanse his
sins he had done in
the company of the
alluring man mage,
Zhalfir.
Page 4: §6Chapter 1

§5-Seven weeks ago, the
hour of the
tendercrisp bacon elf
sandwich.

Page 5: Leaning on the
banister of the
dwarven trade ship,
Chaos saw the Mage's
mighty tower from at
least three fortnight's
walks.

The knight-errant
Chaos had recieved an
ultimatum from the
Dwarven Council.
Page 6: The council were the
rulers of the kingdom
Stoutschmeckle.

Chaos was a simple
man-cow; a mercenary
with a fancy title, and
was by far no means
a hero. He sported a
draping moustache, his
bedraggled hair the
typical burly brown of
his highland homeland.
Page 7: His armor was of
modest leather and
iron, and by chance an
unadorned steel cap
sat atop his head.

No true knight was he.

His equipment
consisted of a sturdy
black mace and a
round shield adorned
with a blue spiral.
Page 8: An ample sack covered
his cape, full of
whimsical odds and
ends necessary for
survival in the world in
which he resided.

The nights were long
and the days were hot,
but in time the sea
voyage met its end.
Page 9: Upon arrival, Chaos
strolled off of the
gangway and onto
solid ground.

The wind whipped up
from the grey ocean
as he beheld the
impressive edifice in
its full glory.
Page 10: Grim clouds slowly
whirled about the top
of the looming
structure, as if by
some...magical force,
perhaps.

He trundled toward
the base of the tower,
and shambled up the
incline to the
entrance.
Page 11: Chaos paused upon
the last step on the
top of the cascading
stairway that led to a
somber, shale door
set in the base of the
stupendous monolith.

A feeling of doubt
washed over him,
quickly being shook
away, knowing he must
press on.
Page 12: He forged his iron will
anew into steel and
reached for the goblin
shaped knocker on the
left of a similar, troll
headed one. 

He recoiled in horror
when the statue's
eyes rolled about
madly.
Page 13: "Wahts we got here
Elliott?" the sentient
copper goblin giggled.

"I thinks its fresh
meat for the master."
squealed Elliott the
troll head.
Page 14: Shat-tap, bitch. You
sound like a shrieking
milkmaid who's just
seen a barewolf!
Page 15: "Oh, certainly," replied
the goblin. "But we are
only here to forewarn
the supple fools who
Master lures in.
Secure your ass
plate, noble knight! For
Master desires
manflesh more than
anything these days.

But business is
business, so says I.
Page 16: So enter, but 
remember us well.

For we are the only
pair of knockers you'll
ever see in this tower!
Hee Hee!"

The two copper beings
parted to the sides as
the gates swung
open.
Page 17: Chaos set forth in
determination. He
passed through the
foreboding entrance
and came upon a
crossroads.

Three halls diverged,
marked by troubling,
leering gargoyles. The
left probed deep into
the innermost clutches
of the burly ground.
Page 18: The one ahead
consisted of a
seemingly endless
hallway. The rightmost
path led up a
mesmerizing staircase.

Chaos' keen snout
sensed a moist wind
emanating from the
spiral staircase.
Page 19: Knowing that the
master wizard. Zhalfir
could only exist in a
solid state in sopping
climes, he turned and
began to ascend the
staircase.
Page 20: "Ware the seductions
of Master," the goblin
echoed from behind.
"Even the straightest
arrow can be bent!"

After the warning,
Elliott let loose a
squeal that sounded a
little bit like a fire
hose sprayed through
an electric fan filled
with pelicans and -
Page 21: whistling track
coaches who had a
little too much time on
their hands and liked
to play tug of war
behind the snack
shack but one day the
tennis kids came by
and tipped it over,
subsequently trapping
them in the tomblike
waste wallow and he
hated his life
Page 22: and all the days after
no one looked at him
quite the same way, not
even his family and
that's what Elliott's
scream sounded like.

Chaos ventured
deeper into the
labyrinthine halls. As
he progressed, he
began to fall into
a dreamlike state.
Page 23: The winding corridors
seemed to shift as
inexplicable enigmas
danced within his
primitive manbrain.

His rhythmic footsteps
were punctuated by
mysterious sounds;
sudden soft laughter,
or the quiet shutting
of a door. 
Page 24: He felt a singular
sense of disquiet as
he strode ever
quicker down the
corridor, fighting the
trancelike waves of
unreality.

He was suddenly
aware of a vast
presence behind him,
and he whirled
around.
Page 25: Shield set and mace
drawn back, but
nothing was there, and
Chaos began to doubt
his own sanity.

§7(Certainly it wasn't
there in the first
place because he kills
a shit load of innocent
people.)
Page 26: Then a notion arose.
Perhaps Chaos was
not really wandering
the halls, not even
moving. Gods! 

He was wandering
within his own mind! He
must get back to
consciousness right
now, lest he wake up
with a sore ass.

Page 27: He struggled through
the blurring mire of
the dreamworld, trying
to reach out for
consciousness.

Finally, with all of his
will, he snapped back
awake, and found
himself in a dim, velvet
room.
Page 28: His armor covered in
rose petals, but
thankfully still on.

Page 0:    ..:::Tower Bridge:::..
         
   Part one of three.

       By: Juelexi
Page 1: When I was but a child,
Only three years of age,
Wearing bonnets and my bottle, 
With everything my way,

My daddy knelt beside me,
He kissed my little face,
`Listen up my little sweet,
Today's a great day!'
Page 2: He smiled so boldly,
His eyes so large and bright,
I laughed and I giggled,
I smiled at his delight,

`How would you like,
The best gift of all,'
He said it so crazily,
I thought it a ball!

Page 3: `There is nothing other,
There is no compare,
What I'll bring you is a brother!
Now isn't that dear!'

He smiled and he laughed,
Telling me of love we would share,
Of friendships that'd last,
Of brotherly care!
Page 4: I thought it the best thing,
To happen to me,
I thought it so splendid,
I laughed out with glee!

He kissed me goodbye,
On the tip of my nose,
`Behave you little tyke,
Your Papa will know!'

Page 5: I waited the whole day,
Tell sun nearly set,
My mother not worried,
Yet boy did I fret!

My bedtime was nigh,
When daddy came back,
His mood just as cherry,
No, nothing was lack!

Page 6: I was the picture of happiness,
So full of joy,
When daddy showed me his bundle,
I saw it was a boy!

Much older than I,
His face smudged and brown,
I looked on in horror,
I made not a sound!
Page 7: Dirty blond hair,
With soft wispy curls,
His face soft with slumber,
I thought I would hurl!

No brother of mine,
I wanted to scream,
But stare on in horror,
I couldn't even breathe!
Page 8: My daddy was delighted,
He thought I was too,
He gave the boy my mother,
And she began to coo!

I wanted to pout,
I wanted to cry,
I knew it no use,
I let out a sigh!

Page 9: The days that would follow,
Were just as I thought,
The boy was a terror,
Yet still had my spot!

The pride of my father,
He won right away,
The love of my mother,
She gave without save!
Page 10: When backs would turn,
The terror would rise,
He'd push and he'd tease,
And then smile into their eyes!

The boy was much older,
Three years or so I'd say,
Page 11: My father took him everywhere,
My mother made him cakes!

I was unhappy,
And very sad-bound,
I cried all the time,
But this brought me frowns!
Page 12: Action I began to take,
And became a terror too,
No longer was it all for me,
There was war between us two!

I never had to fight for things,
Things like a mothers love,
Page 13: But every day the war kept on,
And I learned to kick and shove,

For years the battles kept it up,
Each day the same old thing,
One would try the harder still,
To win my mothers please,
Page 14: I told my mother when I could,
The horrors of that boy,
She would laugh and softly speak,
`Boys will be boys!'

    Book of Poetry

        by: Juelexi
Page 1: Daughter of the Rain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I watch from my window,
As the clouds begin to form,
My heart begins to flutter,
As I await the storm,

I watched as a raindrop fell,
The sun seeming to fade,
Page 2: Then before me I beheld,
a beauty of the rain,

Fair is her skin,
like the moon in the night,
Bright are her eyes,
like the dawns shining light,

Page 3: Golden is her hair,
Like the sun's stretching rays,
So beautiful, so fair,
Is the daughter of the rain,

She sings in the mist, 
With dew drops in her hair,
She then blows me a kiss,

Page 4: Oh so beautiful, so fair,

Like a pale gleaming rose,
Her lips gleam in the rain,
Her eye lids begin to close,
The rain begins to fade,
Page 5: When the shadows fall,
And clouds begin to form,
When the thunder calls,
I fear not the storm,

I sit and I wonder,
At this child so rare,
My heart she has plundered,
Yet I give not a care,
Page 6: Hold her I can't,
To touch is a dream,
She comes and she goes,
Her voice oh so sweet,

Like a winter's chill,
clinging to a midsummer day,
She came,
Like a shadow that must pass away,
She went,
Page 7: So beautiful, so fair,
Oh daughter of the rain,

Sorrows come,
and sorrows go,
The tears that fall,
are sad I know,

But here in this moment,
I reach out my hand,
Greedy I may seem,
but don't you understand?
Page 9: Sorrows come,
in an abundance of pain,
But denying yourself,
only adds to the rain,

Happiness is limited,
that's why I hold tight,
I can't control the sadness,
it's to much of a fight,
Page 10: In holding true to myself,
by reaching out my hand to you,
Happiness can be found,
if only, between us two...

Page 11:      ..:::My Place:::..
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Shadows and hardships, life just a drag... sunk into misery at a world gone bad... Sunshine no longer, and no peaceful rain... Warm light on brown bodies.. chilled rivers untamed...
Page 12: Oh splendid silence, warm rays of washed sun, Oh peaceful valley where only I can come... Fields of flowers basked in all the light, soft wind, silent slumber... everything so right...

Oh where only I go, is a place that only I know...
Page 13: Where dreams and life are one and no heartache can come, Joy in silent breeze, among flowers in fields of green.. where tall trees touch the sky and no beginning can mean no end... Warmth, splendid warmth, that forever comes from within...
Page 14: Lying in a field, arms out stretched, among valleys so large the sky has no depth... Where green trees never turn to brown, and long wispy grasses are soft and sound. The animals untamed yet alive and free, are there in that place that only I can see...
Page 15: Clouds of all shapes and wind almost visible, the rain is a friend and nothing is miserable... Oh in that silent warmth, the place I miss the most.. No longer can I go there, the memory now.. a bitter ghost...

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Silent laugter
Arrognat frowns
Caught and plastered
Cut and bound

Forever smiles
Eerie laughs
Joyous memories
And dark past...
Page 17: Forever silent
Tears that fall
Obnoxious poses
Silent calls

Captured faces
Fine and dark
Silent laughter
Eyes that spark

Cruel or kind
Cut and plastered
Bound for time...

Page 19:       *Stranger*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Shadows fall upon the road,
The sun slowly decends,
Old dusty boots begin to slow,
As the day now comes to an end...
Page 20: Stranger in a world of shadow,
Where do you go?
Why does no one follow
On your long and lonely road?

You sleep under moon and star,
The wind your lullaby,
Tell me stranger from afar,
Why do you cry?
Page 21: Though tears you shed,
When the lonely winds blow,
Your feet still tread,
On that long and lonely road...

Stranger in a a world of sorrow,
The night has passed on by,

Page 22: Still no one has followed,
Is that why you cry?

No friends to be found,
No one to care,
Footprints on the ground,
But only one pair,
Page 23: Drowning in a sea of sorrows,
That comes from lonely trails,
Stranger who does travel,
I pray you farewell...

                 ~end
Page 24:       -Whispers-
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Lil one,
In my arms,
You talk to me,
Of all past harms,

You whisper you're sorry,
Forgiveness you ask,
"Take all my sins,
Please, Father, and cast..."
Page 25: You then go on to tell me,
What you've done in a day,
Whispering in great detail,
Everything, you did say...

You tell me of some people,
Some that are dear to you,
Page 26: You pray for your loved ones,
And those that are new,

You tell me all your troubles,
Worries and fears,
You ask that I help you,
And stay by you near,
Page 27: I hold you tighter,
And place peace on your mind,
I don't forsake my children,
Never leave them behind,

You close your eyes softly,
And ask me for strength,
Page 28: You make me smile,
As you ask me for faith,

Dear child, I'll be there,
When life gets to rough,
I'll be your pillar of strength,
And hold you in my love,
Page 29: Some days will be harder,
And you won't see me anywhere,
You may think I've forsaken,
But I'll always be there,

Tears begin to fall,
As you ask, "What if I fail? What if I can't do it..?"
Page 30: But child, I will prevail,

Two pairs of footprints,
Yours and mine,
But when you see only one pair,
I've carried you, that's why...

You then begin to drift,
There against my arms,
Page 31: You stretch slightly,
And then wake in alarm,

Your eyes turn solemn, 
And your face downcast,
"I'm sorry, dear Lord,
I'm tired, and don't think I'll last..."


Page 32: You looked so sad,
There against my chest,
I couldn't help but smile,
And whisper, "Just Rest..."

Lil one.. My child,
You've crawled unto my lap,

Page 33: I've held you in my arms,
And in my warmth you've wrapped...

My child, I love you,
Rest easy in my grace,
To fall asleep in whispers,
There is no better way...

                  ~end

Black as the Pit from pole to pole,
I thank whatever gods may be
For my unconquerable soul.

I have not winced nor cried aloud.
Under the bludgeonings of chance
My head is bloody, but unbowed.
Page 2: Beyond this place of wrath and tears
Looms but the Horror of the shade,
And yet the menace of the years
Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.

How charged with punishments the scroll.
I am the master of my fate:
I am the captain of my soul.

Page 0: Far over the Misty Mountains cold,
To dungeons deep and caverns old,
We must away, ere break of day,
To seek our pale enchanted gold.
The dwarves of yore made mighty spells, While hammers fell like ringing bells,
Page 1: In places deep, where dark things sleep,
In hollow halls beneath the fells.

For ancient king and elvish lord
There many a gleaming golden hoard
They shaped and wrought,
Page 2: and light they caught,
To hide in gems on hilt of sword.

On silver necklaces they strung
The flowering stars, on crowns they hung
The dragon-fire,
Page 3: on twisted wire
They meshed the light of moon and sun.

Far over the Misty Mountains cold,
To dungeons deep and caverns old,
We must away, ere break of day,
To claim our long-forgotten gold.
Page 4: Goblets they carved there for themselves,
And harps of gold, where no man delves
There lay they long, and many a song
Was sung unheard by men or elves.

The pines were roaring on the heights,
The wind was moaning in the night,
Page 5: The fire was red, it flaming spread,
The trees like torches blazed with light.  

The bells were ringing in the dale,
And men looked up with faces pale.
The dragon's ire, more fierce than fire,
Laid low their towers and houses frail.
Page 6: The mountain smoked beneath the moon.
The dwarves, they heard the tramp of doom.
They fled the hall to dying fall
Beneath his feet, beneath the moon.
Page 7: Far over the Misty Mountains grim,
To dungeons deep and caverns dim,
We must away, ere break of day,
To win our harps and gold from him!

Page 0: "Seldom we find," says Solomon Don Dunce,
"Half an idea in the profoundest sonnet.
Through all the flimsy things we see at once
As easily as through a Naples bonnet-
Trash of all trash!- how can a lady don it?
Page 1: Yet heavier far than your Petrarchan stuff-
Owl-downy nonsense that the faintest puff
Twirls into trunk-paper the while you con it."
Page 2: And, veritably, Sol is right enough.
The general tuckermanities are arrant
Bubbles- ephemeral and so transparent-
But this is, now- you may depend upon it-
Page 3: Stable, opaque, immortal- all by dint
Of the dear names that he concealed within 't.

Page 0: O say can you see by the dawn's early light,
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming,
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,
O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?
Page 1: And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there;
O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave,
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?
Page 2: On the shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep,
Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes,
What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep,
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?
Page 3: Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam,
In full glory reflected now shines in the stream:
'Tis the star-spangled banner, O! long may it wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

Page 4: And where is that band who so vauntingly swore
That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion,
A home and a country, should leave us no more?
Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps' pollution.
Page 5: No refuge could save the hireling and slave
From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave:
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave,
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.
Page 6: O thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand
Between their loved home and the war's desolation.
Blest with vict'ry and peace, may the Heav'n rescued land
Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation!
Page 7: Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,
And this be our motto: "In God is our trust."
And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!

§0§0  On one chilly day, Greennao, walked the streets of Redstone as he aproached a small store. He entered the little shop, welcomed by its warmth. Taking off his outer layers revealing a plaid sweater
Page 3: §0§0and his classic blue jeans. He walks in line, nervous by being surrounded by so many people. §0
§0§0  Meanwhile, a handsome young man named Puar. PuarZilla that is, enters taking off his coat and placing it on the hook lovingly. He winked at the young 
Page 4: §0§0sipping coffee while whispering their rumors. Puar smiled sadly passing by them. He knew he wasn't fit for anyone, no matter what he looked like. §0
§0§0  Puar entered the line behind the young fellow named Green. The two stood in silence studying thie
Page 5: §0§0surroundings without a word. Until Green turned around. His eyes met Puar's as he wispered, " H-hello." Puar smiled cautiously as his face flushed instantly. §0
§0§0 As the line progressed the became more fond of each other. 
Page 6: §0§0Reaching the counter. Green orders a cup of Sugar Tea, and Puar black coffee with a hint of peppermint creme. §0
§0§0  The two sit. Sipping thier bevrages peacefully. Green looks at his candy stirrer... §0
§0§0 Innocently he licks it. Tasting the color
Page 7: §0§0of flavor as the sweetness rolls across his toungue.§0
§0§0 Puar helplessly watches enthused as the tease continues.§0
§0§0 Green looking up realizes what he has been doing and blushes. His candied lips parting, but no words coming out. §0
§0§0 Puar ca
Page 8: §0§0leans torwards Green looking into his eyes. §0
§0§0 Greennao, grazes his lips across Puar's tasting the bitterness of the coffee he was drinking.§0
§0§0 Puar pulls him into a kiss. Green submissively complies, as Puar pulls him deeper laying
Page 9: §0§0his hand on Green's thigh gingerly.§0
§0§0  Parting after some time, they look back into each others eyes and promptly leave and head to Puar's condo. Where they can be alone.§0

§0§0Audrey went to a coffee shop to get coffee. What the hell else would she get at

Page 4: §0§0[Present]§0
§0§0I saw the Meteor flying down, ready for impact, and knew I had to stop it. I planned slowly and carefully, aligning my mouth perfectly to it. There was sweat on my chin when the red throbbing meteors head landed in my mouth. I knew this
Page 5: §0§0too much for one person to handle, as it was nearly 4 inches from the ground. The Meteor picked a target of it's taste, a busty tan girl with brown hair, that goes by the name of nrokin. It thrusted back and forth, and I had to act quickly if I wanted 
Page 6: §0§0take down this meteor. I quickly pulled out my tracfone while battling this beast and texted my best friend Vic. You could describe her as very pale, but not as busty, with beautiful hair. She hurried over as fast as she could to help take down this
Page 7: §0§0meteor before we could put more people at risk. Victoria and I battled for the head of the meteor, trying our best to take turns, although the meteor kept beating us with it's stick, trying to tell us that it only has a couple of minutes left. That onl
Page 8: §0§0meant we had to work harder and harder to take it down, and that's when it happened, the meteor exploded into a giant white shower of amazingness all over our faces, and we licked off eachothers faces, spitting it into eachother's mouths. We then finis

Page 0: Prologue:

Despite the downpour,
Chaos boldy ventured
on into the woeful
valley of
blackened elms.

The sopping sounds of
his splashing feet
echoed into the still,
rain-drenched woods.
Page 1: The burdens he bore
were great, not only
those on his
back, but those of the
heavy toll of sin on
his soul.

Everyone. Not a single
peasant spared. He
mused over his
decision to kill
everyone that looked
like the damned.
Page 2: "Perhaps my judgement
was too harsh. Yes,
that woman really
meant no harm."

He chuckled in
remembrance of the
mass slaughter in the
peaceful hamlet.
Chaos was a hearty
paladin-cow.
Page 3: He didn't stop to think
as he systematically
purged the entire
town.
Penance must be paid

He was on a spiritual
quest to cleanse his
sins he had done in
the company of the
alluring man mage,
Zhalfir.
Page 4: Chapter 1

-Seven weeks ago, the
hour of the
tendercrisp bacon elf
sandwich.
Page 5: Leaning on the
banister of the
dwarven trade ship,
Chaos saw the Mage's
mighty tower from at
least three fortnight's
walks.

The knight-errant
Chaos had recieved an
ultimatum from the
Dwarven Council.
Page 6: The council were the
rulers of the kingdom
Stoutschmeckle.

Chaos was a simple
man-cow; a mercenary
with a fancy title, and
was by far no means
a hero. He sported a
draping moustache, his
bedraggled hair the
typical burly brown of
his highland homeland.
Page 7: His armor was of
modest leather and
iron, and by chance an
unadorned steel cap
sat atop his head.

No true knight was he.

His equipment
consisted of a sturdy
black mace and a
round shield adorned
with a blue spiral.
Page 8: An ample sack covered
his cape, full of
whimsical odds and
ends necessary for
survival in the world in
which he resided.

The nights were long
and the days were hot,
but in time the sea
voyage met its end.
Page 9: Upon arrival, Chaos
strolled off of the
gangway and onto
solid ground.

The wind whipped up
from the grey ocean
as he beheld the
impressive edifice in
its full glory.
Page 10: Grim clouds slowly
whirled about the top
of the looming
structure, as if by
some...magical force,
perhaps.

He trundled toward
the base of the tower,
and shambled up the
incline to the
entrance.
Page 11: Chaos paused upon
the last step on the
top of the cascading
stairway that led to a
somber, shale door
set in the base of the
stupendous monolith.

A feeling of doubt
washed over him,
quickly being shook
away, knowing he must
press on.
Page 12: He forged his iron will
anew into steel and
reached for the goblin
shaped knocker on the
left of a similar, troll
headed one. 

He recoiled in horror
when the statue's
eyes rolled about
madly.
Page 13: 
"Wahts we got here
Elliott?" the sentient
copper goblin giggled.

"I thinks its fresh
meat for the master."
squealed Elliott the
troll head.
Page 14: "Shat-tap, bitch. You
sound like a shrieking
milkmaid who's just
seen a barewolf!"
retorted the goblin.
"What say you, you
magical trickeries and
metallic neon-eyed
fiends?" probed
Chaos.
"Am I not entitled to
enter the tower?"
Page 15: "Oh, certainly," replied
the goblin. "But we are
only here to forewarn
the supple fools who
Master lures in.
Secure your ass
plate, noble knight! For
Master desires
manflesh more than
anything these days.

But business is
business, so says I.
Page 16: So enter, but 
remember us well.

For we are the only
pair of knockers you'll
ever see in this tower!
Hee Hee!"

The two copper beings
parted to the sides as
the gates swung
open.
Page 17: Chaos set forth in
determination. He
passed through the
foreboding entrance
and came upon a
crossroads.

Three halls diverged,
marked by troubling,
leering gargoyles. The
left probed deep into
the innermost clutches
of the burly ground.
Page 18: The one ahead
consisted of a
seemingly endless
hallway. The rightmost
path led up a
mesmerizing staircase.

Chaos' keen snout
sensed a moist wind
emanating from the
spiral staircase.
Page 19: Knowing that the
master wizard. Zhalfir
could only exist in a
solid state in sopping
climes, he turned and
began to ascend the
staircase.
Page 20: "Ware the seductions
of Master," the goblin
echoed from behind.
"Even the straightest
arrow can be bent!"

After the warning,
Elliott let loose a
squeal that sounded a
little bit like a fire
hose sprayed through
an electric fan filled
with pelicans and -
Page 21: whistling track
coaches who had a
little too much time on
their hands and liked
to play tug of war
behind the snack
shack but one day the
tennis kids came by
and tipped it over,
subsequently trapping
them in the tomblike
waste wallow and he
hated his life
Page 22: and all the days after
no one looked at him
quite the same way, not
even his family and
that's what Elliott's
scream sounded like.

Chaos ventured
deeper into the
labyrinthine halls. As
he progressed, he
began to fall into
a dreamlike state.
Page 23: The winding corridors
seemed to shift as
inexplicable enigmas
danced within his
primitive manbrain.

His rhythmic footsteps
were punctuated by
mysterious sounds;
sudden soft laughter,
or the quiet shutting
of a door.
Page 24: He felt a singular
sense of disquiet as
he strode ever
quicker down the
corridor, fighting the
trancelike waves of
unreality.

He was suddenly
aware of a vast
presence behind him,
and he whirled
around.
Page 25: Shield set and mace
drawn back, but
nothing was there, and
Chaos began to doubt
his own sanity.

(Certainly it wasn't
there in the first
place because he kills
a shit load of innocent
people.)
Page 26: Then a notion arose.
Perhaps Chaos was
not really wandering
the halls, not even
moving. Gods! 

He was wandering
within his own mind! He
must get back to
consciousness right
now, lest he wake up
with a sore ass.
Page 27: He struggled through
the blurring mire of
the dreamworld, trying
to reach out for
consciousness.

Finally, with all of his
will, he snapped back
awake, and found
himself in a dim, velvet
room.
Page 28: His armor covered in
rose petals, but
thankfully still on.

End of:
Chapter 1

Page 0: John woke up, he always woke up before any sound was there to wake him, but no-one would ever actually know that, he waiting on his bed with his eyes closed, going back over his thoughts from the night before, feeling the torrent begin again,
Page 1: the masses of information swirled around his head, it was like loud rock music being blasted directly into his brain and it almost always ended with him getting a headache. After what felt like a few minutes had passed, he heard the sound of his mother
Page 2: calling him from downstairs, there was some logic missing in this, he had long ago decided, as he always, without fail, got up fifteen minutes before he was meant to be at school, which was the exact amount of time it took for him to throw on his uniform,
Page 3: eat breakfast, and take the short journey to school. John's mother however, had never seemed to grasp this fact, and insisted on calling him down approximately forty-five minutes before he had to be there, despite him remaining in his state
Page 4: of psudo-sleep for another half and hour, he did not fail to meet this tradition on that particular morning. After the usual argument about this morning ritual had taken place, and no ground had been made by either individual, he lifelessly chewed on his 
Page 5: toast and made his way to school, he arrived slinging his bag onto the floor and waiting for the morning period to start, some people he considered his friends chatted amiably in the background about nothing in particular and he continued to sit there,
Page 6: not paying any heed, the teacher arrived and he stood up, his teachers name was Dr Smith and she was one of the few teachers in the school who seemed to have an ounce of logic, and therefore he respected her greatly, logic being something that was in 
Page 7: short supply in the world in general, still feeling that same sense of disconnecteddness he shuffled into the room and took his seat, he took out a pad of paper and absently began to write, not paying any particular attention to what he wrote, he looked
Page 8: down and proclaimed it to be garbage and scrunched it up and shoved it in a pocket for either some further use later or to be thrown away, he played with his pen, only pausing in his thoughts to respond to his name being called, he was struck by a sudden 
Page 9: and totally irrational sadness, his mind helpfully threw up some images of the worst events he could think about and his hands started to shake, he stilled them with a concious mental effort and began trying to focus on what the teacher was saying, the
Page 10: words slipping out of his mind, he suffered from working and short term memory issues, that was what the report said anyway, his attention rapidly diminished and he went back to his pen, which he looked at sadly and put away, his friend said something
Page 11: to him which he responded to without thinking, he was suddenly and without any kind of warning very irritated by this and wanted to be alone. It was horrible, the way he viewed the world constantly shifting and changing, with no reason or method.
Page 12: He wanted to scream and run out of the classroom, and finally break down and let his emotions run, but he never would, he had to keep up the appearence of sanity, or what was left of it, people did notice his strangeness, he was an oddity and could never
Page 13: seem to say the right thing, he glared enviously at the people to whom the right things to say seemed to come so easily, he attempted to smile and only managed to make his face scrunch into something horrible, people gave him odd looks and he tried to
Page 14: cover it with a signature manic smile, he would rather let it be known that he was odd that let people know he just couldn't do it, his face wouldn't do what he wanted it to, and it always ended up looking stupid, inappropriate, or both.


Page 15: The bell rang, waking John from his idle musings, he grabbed his bag and made his way to the biology classroom. The rest of the day was filled with idle conversation with the few people who wanted to talk to him, or at least were willing to, and the
Page 16: scratching of his pen on paper, writing words, but never the ones that he wanted to write, words without meaning.

The clock lazily swung its hands towards the ending of the day, and he swung his backpack onto his back. When he got home he went on
Page 17: his computer, looking at several things that did make him laugh internally, he was not humourless, as some people thought, it was just that he was never really able to express his joy, or at least that was what he told himself. His mother greeted him when
Page 18: he got home and he dutifully filled out the expected role and said his day was fine with a forced smile, people irritated him, it wasn't their fault, they just did what they were expected to do, they filled their roles, because they had never been taught 
Page 19: that they were allowed to become more than what was expected, to think outside the box and actually act on those obscure concepts such as 'making the world a better place'. John could never do that, not since he had realised that he didn't have to, but it
Page 20: still got to him, not that people rejected him for it, it would take more than that to break his will, but more the shrugs of indifference that they expressed, like they had seen it before, he was just another kid who thought rebellion was as simple as
Page 21: declaring yourself different and wearing black, but he never intended to do that, he wanted to go out and face the darkness of the world, force it to confront him, but the world would not listen.

Besides, he knew it wasn't that simple, people could not
Page 22: just go out and face the dark like batman and superman, that would not change anything, he might, if he became a policeman stop a hundred or a thousand crimes, but that would not change anything, what was needed was something that would change the world,
Page 23: permanently for the better, to finally make people realised that it was something different to declare that people should respect others regardless of who they were, and to actually act upon it, the difference between carrying out the role of someone
Page 24: who wanted things to change, and the person who actually sits there and tries to work out how to make the world a better place for everyone, once and for all...

Page 0: §0§0John stared out of the window over the houses, each one with a few people, all going about their lives normally, a cool breeze touched his face and he wondered why he couldn't be like them, of course he was sure others had felt this way, it was unlikel
Page 1: §0§0that he was the first, yet he still thought it and wondered how they managed to, to go to parties and generally be socially functioning, normal people, John didn't have many friends, and he had never spoken with anyone about anything of truly great imp
Page 2: §0§0about himself, the house felt more like a prison than a place to live, he couldn't stand it, the energy coursing though his veins, he wanted to go outside and scream at the world until he found someone who was the same, but he never would, he could nev
Page 3: §0§0just abandon the pretense of sanity, yet he continued to feel like an outsider. If John ever spoke to people about the regular trivial things that people so often talk about, it was usually because he was thrust into the situation against his will.
Page 4: §0§0His thoughts raced, neurons firing carrying precious data working on one thousand and one problems that he would probably never work out the solution to before he was hit by it again, the overwhelming sense that it was pointless and that he should just
Page 5: §0§0give up.§0
§0§0He would have sighed, but he didn't make sounds when he was alone, it never seemed right to him, he closed the window and took a spinning jump onto his bed, sprawling himself on the sheets that just seemed rough and uncomfortable,
Page 6: §0§0waiting silently for the maelstrom of his thoughts to calm so he could finally fall asleep.

What is Laveyan satanism? 
Page 1: Neo (laveyan) satanism is also known as Athiestic satanism, its a selfish non thiestic religion that teaches social darwinism and egoism. Social darwinism is the idea that we apply the concept of natural selection to our society. "Only the strong survive"
Page 2: This idea is rejected by most rational people due to its total abandon of human nature. Our society makes it near impossible for natural selection to occur. 
Lavayan satanism has seven tenants or laws, as well as seven "sins" 
Page 3: Laveyan satanism also condones the practice of "magick". They believe that a man or womans willpower in thought can effect the physical world. They worship more the idea of a literary satan. Unlike thiestic satanism or "luciferianism" 
Page 4: There are multiple sects of modern satanism, the sect i am a member or is known as The Satanic Temple. We reject the ideas of social darwininism,Magick and egoism. We instead take a more humanistic approach. Our sect is based primarily in the united state
Page 5: We use our constitutional right to freedom of religion in order to oppose laws that threaten the seperation of church and state or are otherwise unreasonable. We are, in essence a psuedo religious organization who use legal technicalities to fight
Page 6: religious oppression.  The moral of this short pamphlet is....
Page 7: Satanists are not evil, we are not vile, we do not worship an evil diety and for FUCKS SAKES we do not sacrifice children. As a matter of fact the satanic temple has declared may 15th "Protect children day" Want to know more? visit www.thesatanictemple.

§0§0  Meanwhile, a handsome young man named Puar. PuarZilla that is, enters taking off his coat and placing it on the hook lovingly. He winked at the young

§0§0[3 Minutes Before]§0
§0§0 Twas 3 minutes before it all came down. I was sitting on the couch sweat beaten wearing nothing when I heard it coming. It opened the door, and turned out to be Puar. It came with a thrust all over my bust. 
Page 4: §0§0[Present]§0
§0§0I saw the Meteor flying down, ready for impact, and knew I had to stop it. I planned slowly and carefully, aligning my mouth perfectly to it. There was sweat on my chin when the red throbbing meteors head landed in my mouth. I knew this
Page 5: §0§0too much for one person to handle, as it was nearly 4 inches from the ground. The Meteor picked a target of it's taste, a busty tan girl with brown hair, that goes by the name of nrokin. It thrusted back and forth, and I had to act quickly if I wanted

Commands:

/fl name - this forces someone into local. 

/denoob - you know what this does


Page 1: /mp name channel
and
/ump name channel
mutes and unmutes a player in specified channel.

/newestregion: takes you to the newest /village for new players.
Page 2: Guidelines on mutes:

1. Do not mute someone for personal reasons, a few caps, or as a joke. Do not mute them if they sent 2 duplicate lines, like during lag spikes. Do not mute them unless they are an obvious disruption to chat.
Page 3: 2. Don't argue with people in global channels. Keep it in /tell or local.

3. Always be in noob chat. You will hear a ding noise everytime a new player joins. Say hi, welcome them. Be nice. Pay attention to noob chat.
Page 4: 4. You represent the server so act like it. Don't be a jerk like the admins. Be nice.

5. Learn how to be trolled and get used to them trying to make you mad on purpose. Some players love to pick on the younger staff memebers.
Page 5: 6. Unmuting:

NEVER unmute anyone from noob chat. ever.

If the player can tell you why they were muted and apologize for it, then you may unmute them. If they don't know, talk to them until they figure it out.
Page 6: Most important rule:

Staff chat is not filtered. It is mostly 18+ and can be out of hand sometimes. If you feel uncomfortable in staff chat at any time just /leave st. What goes on in staff chat is kept in staff chat. You are not to repeat things said in
Page 7: staff chat! Its very easy for us to find 'leaks' so please keep in mind, staff chat exists for a reason.

Page 0: Dear Victoria (Aucoin, if you were wondering)

You may not know me but i sure know you.  I am writing this book to inform you of something very important that has been haunting me for a while now.  I hope that you take the time to read all that i write
Page 1: in this book.  Btw the book has no title, what do you think i should call this book? I was think something like "When life gives you paper, an ink sac, and a feather, make a book and quill and write a book to Victoria" but that didnt seem to fit the story
Page 2: of the book...  So if you have any suggestions for the title of this book please leave it in the suggestions box located next to your bed.  OMG vic gurrl i just remembered a funny story! Remember that time we were hanging out at my house when i got 
Page 3: griefed?? I invited u to my house and you were really nice and helped fix my house i really appreciated it even though it only lasted about 2 seconds and u didn't stay for the huge feast i had prepared. But its ok because i gave it to my dog (hes fat like
Page 4: really really fat) Anyways, yea that was so fun am i right? And if you were wondering, ive been taking care of your castle and your plants although, i hope you haven't completely abandoned it because it has been about 5 years that appointed me this job 
Page 5: and i haven't seen you since then but i know that you're very busy and all and hey! no hurry on my paycheck dont worry about me i dont need money or food to survive or anything.  Do you still have our best friends forever bracelet? i still have mine!!!
Page 6: what about our best friends necklace? or ring? or ear ring? or belly button piercing? or ankle bracelets? or nose rings? i still have all of them if you were wondering.  OH AND ALSO ROSES ARE RED AND VIOLETS ARE BLUE IN CASE U R COLOR BLIND OR SOMETHING

Page 0: Hello, i didnt came here to play as a normal player, i came here to acomplish what i started a year ago. what we started, Sabbing, chozo, creepy, me and many others. this wont have anny ''big effect'' and not long term one as well but you know, a castle 
Page 1: is made of thousand rocks so slowly we add them one by one. in case you dont already see it, im about to fly away like a damn phoenix, litterally, like in movies with a big ball'o fire.i would like to thank alot of people on here that helped me from 
Page 2: different ways ( money, materials'n shit) to help me get my achievement. If you didnt noticed yet, people are more and more complaining about the lag and you need to restart the survival world really often. this all caused by the 14 lag machine hiden all 
Page 3: arround the surviavl world ( mostly near towns and where most player go) they go from bed rock to near the surface. about 45 blocks long, these are 2 rows of pistons pushing gravel/sand. and that powered by a speeding clock. hope you guys find them soon. 
Page 4: (or not) Also, i went thru well know towns and spawned couple of withers, destroying and killing everything around. not much but still a brick in the fucking castle as i said earlier. by the end of all that, i strongly suggest you to change server, to
Page 5: stop playing minecraft or even just go on this server instead (199.192.79.10) in case you didnt got it, its sabbing's server. as She started her military service, i want to give her the gift of getting back all the fans she lost because of Mumblerit shity
Page 6: attitude toward his staff. I had a server for some time and even if im not that experimented, i know there are things thats you DONT say to people, even if you dont know them ''irl'' shit still hurt thru that screen. And maybe thats why toboein left
Page 7: you mumble, maybe she was tired about how you treat people and look at them as if they were all dummies or shit you have to clean on your sidewalk. and so did Fvqu and probably many other staff i didnt know or dont remember. From all those people,
Page 8: (tehsabbingslayer,Chozo4, Creepy, Toboein, Fvqu, all exadiawind players and me are telling you a big 
''Fuck you asshole'' and sincerly mean it. you would definitively know what it like to take something in the ass. so yeah, for your future experiences,
Page 9: stop treating your staff like shit, stop behing homophobic and try to know your server better, you stopped interacting with players and thats what will kill this place, your attitude... this book will be send to all presently connected players and will be
Page 10: market if some need it. i hope you folks realize and for the last time, Fuck you.

Page 1:  In the beginning, satan created the nether and the land. Now the nether was formless and empty, the darkness hovering in the deep, and the main world hovering above the waters.
 And satan said, "let there be dark", and there was dark. He saw the dark...
Page 2: as good, and the light as bad. Satan called the light "day", and the darkness "night". But he wanted the darkness to be everlasting. Satan took the light, and he put it into the main world with other evils. 
 He created a barrier between the nether and
Page 3: the overworld. Therefore, no living being was allowed to pass into the evil that lurked in the overworld. So, yeah.

Page 0: Nicole waved at the security guard at the building across the street, causing him to give her a puzzled look.

They of course didn't know eachother, it was unsurprising considering as a deadly assassin she rarely befriended
Page 1: security guards, it would be sort of like a bank robber befriending a cashier.

She walked across the street smiling sweetly, the guard still looking mildly puzzled.

'Hey, it's Bill isn't it?' she said 'We met at that thing last week?'
Page 2: 'I have no idea who you are' he replied in a rather toneless voice. 'Also my name is Steve'

'Right! Steve of course, how could I get you mixed up with Bill!' Nicole smoothly replied.
Page 3: 'My name isn't Steve either, you're either attempting to distract me or bluff your way past me and it's not going to work' he stiffly replied.

'Well it was worth a shot, would you mind holding this for me a second?' 
Page 4: said Nicole passing him a pink umbrella with a floral design.

The security guard looked amused and accepted the umbrella, which immediately exploded killing him, Nicole stepped over the body and continued into the
Page 5: building....

The lobby was decorated for Christmas and there were five security guards pointing guns at her and demanding she get on the floor. 

They clearly did not mean that she should beam at them and 
Page 6: sit on the floor cross legged but this is nonetheless what she did, one of the security guards told her such in no uncertain words and when she refused he rather rudely attempted to shoot her.
Page 7: He did not appear to realise that she had earlier snuck into the security guard's armoury through a ventilation shaft and replaced all of the guard's guns with confetti firing replicas.

After a rather amusing but less than
Page 8: deadly confetti shower she proceeded to grab a Christmas wreath off a wall and strangle one of the guards with it, she took a few deadly throwing 'Christmas' stars out of her bag and down went the second and third guard.
Page 9: As the second two bolted she started humming 'Rudolf the red nosed reindeer', triggering the sound activated Santa-shaped bomb she casually lobbed after them.

She proceeded up the elevator to the top floor, the boss sat
Page 10: in a comfortable ergonomic chair as the humming assassin walked into his office, he immediately pulled a shotgun out from underneath his desk...
Page 11: Nicole quickly dodged out of the way of the first shot and grabbed some christmas lights off the wall, she did a backflip over the next shot and landed perfectly behind the boss, wrapped the christmas lights around his neck and threw him out
Page 12: the window.

She whistled as she calmly stepped out of the window and began to absail down the building using the christmas lights, as she passed the boss she gave him a friendly kick. She calmly walked away from the scenes of
Page 13: destruction and smiled at the firemen and policemen, she grabbed one of them on the arm.

'Hey, you're really cute, stand two feet to the left for a minute'

The fireman bemusedly complied and two seconds later all of the others were
Page 14: crushed as the top of the building exploded.

Page 0: My good sir I write this letter, to tell you of my site,
for at the time of writing I am not a pretty sight,
my hunger bar is empty, my hearts a deathly grey.
And I write this note to tell you why I'm not on mutts today.
Page 1: Whilst working on survival some tickets I had to do,
but fixing some kids problems was not an easy- do,
the kid was not pleased with my work, he is an awful sod,
he said I took some diamonds and committed fraud
Page 2: Now I tried to clear things up a bit before we came to blows,
but I had not expected that he'd try to me depose,
in my haste to clear things up he cried abuse at me,
and we argued in the morning, till half past fucking three.
Page 3: So when I finished fighting with this stupid cad,
I noticed that some inventory mail I had,
A message from a loyal fan, I was so pleased to see...
Until I saw it was some noob who'd had a griefed tree.
Page 4: Well so I fixed this stupid grief and got ready to go to bed,
when suddenly a loud blast rocked me fucking head,
I turned around suddenly and to my dismay I see...
Someone covered my house in five hundred tnt!
Page 5: Well when I saw the crater I knew what had transpired,
NRH sat giggling like a fucking child,
I sighed and began to rollback the area...
When suddenly I was attacked by my terrier.
Page 6: Now the force of this collision knocked the laptop from me lap,
and by this point I could hardly give a crap,
I reached down beside my chair and was enraged to see,
The server had gone and crashed unexpectedly.
Page 7: Now normally I wouldn't care too much about this anomaly,
but when I returned my house was still made of tnt!
I threw my laptop on the floor and the screen did then crack,
unfortunately taking with it my fucking back.
Page 8: The force of the collision from the laptop to the floor, had caused my chair to tumble and hit my decor,
in a tangle of wires and broken glass, I then tried to get up and landed on me ass.
Page 9: Dazed and without any computer to use,
All my lights then blew a fucking fuse,
stumbling around in the dark it is clear for you to see,
that I can't attend the staff meeting on teamspeak.

§0§0[3 Minutes Before]§0
§0§0 Twas 3 minutes before it all came down. I was sitting on the couch sweat beaten wearing nothing when I heard it coming. It opened the door, and turned out to be Puar. It came with a thrust all over my bust. 
Page 4: §0§0[Present]§0
§0§0I saw the Meteor flying down, ready for impact, and knew I had to stop it. I planned slowly and carefully, aligning my mouth perfectly to it. There was sweat on my chin when the red throbbing meteors head landed in my mouth. I knew this
Page 5: §0§0too much for one person to handle, as it was nearly 4 inches from the ground. The Meteor picked a target of it's taste, a busty tan girl with brown hair, that goes by the name of nrokin. It thrusted back and forth, and I had to act quickly if I wanted 
Page 6: §0§0take down this meteor. I quickly pulled out my tracfone while battling this beast and texted my best friend Vic. You could describe her as very pale, but not as busty, with beautiful hair. She hurried over as fast as she could to help take down this
Page 7: §0§0meteor before we could put more people at risk. Victoria and I battled for the head of the meteor, trying our best to take turns, although the meteor kept beating us with it's stick, trying to tell us that it only has a couple of minutes left. That onl
Page 8: §0§0meant we had to work harder and harder to take it down, and that's when it happened, the meteor exploded into a giant white shower of amazingness all over our faces, and we licked off eachothers faces, spitting it into eachother's mouths. We then finis
Page 9: §0§0it off by swallowing. They then spend the next hour or so entertaining themselves in ways TehSabbingSlayer would have enjoyed. They know it won't be the last meteor, so they will always be ready to take down another together, otherwise the whole

§0§0Audrey went to a coffee shop to get coffee. What the hell else would she get at

    This week in the muttsworld community
we had reports of chickens randomly spawning on players. This occurance has caused question in how the world of minecraft really works.
Page 2:      In further news, Ekip publishing has dominated the market with two popular novels -- "The Name Steve" & "Black Marsh". They have recently announced the publishing of more novels and learning books.
Page 3:     We have had reports of mass vote spam. I guess this is the hype for the server. I would suggest to go vote and support its cause.

   Meanwhile the community economy is at an all time high as prices are decreasing.

§0
§2   §0One night a woman went out for drinks with her girlfriends. She left the bar fairly late at night, got in her car and onto the deserted highway. After a few minutes she noticed a lone pair of headlights in her rear-view mirror, 
Page 2: approaching at a pace just slightly quicker than hers. As the car pulled up behind her she glanced and saw the turn signal on  the car was going to pass  when suddenly it swerved back behind her, pulled up dangerously close to her tailgate 
Page 3: and the brights flashed. Now she was getting nervous. The lights dimmed for a moment and then the brights came back on and the car behind her surged forward. The frightened woman struggled to keep her eyes on the road and fought 
Page 4: the urge to look at the car behind her. Finally, her exit approached but the car continued to follow, flashing the brights periodically. Through every stoplight and turn, it followed her until she pulled into her driveway.
Page 5: She figured her only hope was to make a mad dash into the house and call the §0police.As§0 she flew from the car, so did the driver of the car behind her  and he screamed, "Lock the door and call the police! Call 911!"
Page 6: When the police arrived the horrible truth was finally revealed to the woman. The man in the car had been trying to save her. As he pulled up behind her and his headlights illuminated her car, 
Page 7: he saw the silhouette of a man with a butcher knife rising up from the back seat to stab her,so he flashed his brights and the figure crouched back down. 
Page 8: The moral of the story: Always check the back seat! §0

Page 0: You know CandyServal, and I know he got banned from creative server. He is my friend and I want to show him a fiew things on creative. But I cant, I just want to give you a fiew reasons to unban Candy from creative, He tells me he did nothing, your 
Page 1: ??probaly thinking that thats just an excuse and thats what they all say, But this is serious, I know him and he swore on his LIFE!§0
§0He did not do anything, and I believe him. And I think you should believe him too. And it still is unfair that I cant even 
Page 2: show him something that I made, He should be able to atleast go on there and not build. And even If you unban him. Well this is now Candy writing and I'm here to state that the ban was directly after I was sending all the players off Creative to try to 
Page 3: stop the new players into leaving creative so everything would die down. But then you banned me after I was telling Lettuce to leave me alone. Why? It doesn't make ANY sense. Endermann2006 now writing, You heard him and now you will hear me
Page 4: I trust him on everything in survival, my mansion, my original home, and he trusts me in his Desert Elite group. If you do unban him, And he is allowed to enter creative server, I will watch him and see what he does, and I will never
Page 5: see him do anything §0wrong.So§0 if you think you can deny this book, Then proove it with some evidence

§0(This is a real written story made by CinnSesame.. It was put into this book and quill)
Page 1: Prologue:Evalq the Dragon§0
§0
§0A long time ago, there was a dragon named Evalq. He lived in the deepest, darkest, most evil woods. No one could find him. The trees never grew leaves, the ground would stay barren. The nights would be so creepy that even the 
Page 2: little critters stayed away. Did Evalq like it? Yes it was paradise to him.§0
§0    The only life in the deep forest was Evalq. His skin was oily black and reflected the moonlight in the strangest ways. His claws were mighty sharp, but they were never used 
Page 3: for killing anything for there was no need to. His eyes were cruel; they would scare anyone away, as if anyone would be daring enough to search the forest. His whole body was a very deep black, so dark that he blended in with the night sky.§0
§0     Evalq
Page 4: usually didn't breathe flames. But as Evalq flew over the night world, his perfect eyes spotted something unusual. A slight, little, leaping leaf, yes, a frog, was jumping around the dark grey rocks. §0
§0    Evalq narrowed his evil eyes. He looked up, 
Page 5: coughed once, and then blew flames so hot they seared the black trees around the frog turned to ashes. Once the smoke parted, no colorful thing was jumping around anymore. 
Page 6: Chapter 1: New Life§0
§0The morning never came in the deep woods. It would always look gloomy and foggy, or it would be eerie and quiet at night.§0
§0   So, you know how it's always dark? Bright animals can't blend in, like this firefly. Poor firefly... It 
Page 7: couldn't even fly away from fire.§0
§0   Evalq sensed something wrong. Why did a frog and firefly come to his forest when it has been a whole 50 years of silence? It was a bit hard to blow fire after all those years. The forest was Evalq's, and no intruders 
Page 8: should pass.§0
§0   In the fog, enough condensation gathered up to make a few drops of sickly water. Thought it was small, a little makes a lot. It gave a tree it clung to a chance to live.§0
§0   The next night, the tree looked dark brown. The burnt blackness 
Page 9: was fading away on the tree. Evalq had skipped over this little change, and the tree kept growing.§0
§0   Again, the fog made a few special drops of water that slid down the trunk and soaked into the dirt. It seemed as if hope and happiness danced around the 
Page 10: tree and the fog saved up water specially for it. Moonlight shone down and made a spotlight for the magical tree. It was a miracle that Evalq hasn't noticed yet.§0
§0   Night after night, a flash of purple and white hotness spread over the ground. Though the 
Page 11: air got dusty and smoke-filled, it seemed as if the forest opened up for the new growing tree.§0

Page 1: On a hot summer's night in the middle of Sanford, a shadow creeped through the dark passages of the streets.§0
§0The night's sky streaked with stars guiding the shadow through houses and under trees.§0
§0Citizens asleep, not knowing about the shadow.
Page 2: The shadow creeped down Horse Road, it knew what it was looking for. It opened the gate to A&V Horse Stud and crawled inside.§0
§0
§0    This is the story§0
§0    of the great gift§0
§0    of everything.
Page 3: The ground started to shake as the clouds appeared. And then, all of a sudden, lightning struck the highest guard tower.§0
§0And in that moment, the shadow was gone.§0
§0Leaving no trail, the shadow disappeared into the thick undergrowth of the jungle.
Page 4: When the citizens of Sanford woke that next day, they knew nothing of the shadow and its strange appearance.§0
§0When Wolf, the owner of A&V Horse Stud woke, she looked out her window to see a huge, burnt black mark on the guard tower in front of her
Page 5: window. The tower was not damaged in any way, it was just burnt.§0
§0Wolf skipped down the stairs and out the front door into her porch. She quickly whipped her head around, checking for any danger that might lay outside. It was clear. She then proceeded to
Page 6: hurry to the tower.§0
§0When she arrived she was shocked to see that the tower was no longer burnt, but in fact not touched at all.§0
§0"Hmm, that's strange." she stated to herself.§0
§0Thinking no more of it, she went back to her tiny farm.
Page 7: Meanwhile, on the other side of town, the shadow looked down upon the village...§0

§0
§0The URU is one of the rarest types of horse. The URU means: Ultra Rare Undead§0
§0or their full name:§0
§0The Ultra Rare Undead/Zombie Horse, shortened it would be the TURUZH, but that's a bit of a long name.
Page 1: At my farm... oh, I never told you my name! My name is WolfGirl1901, or Wolf for short.§0
§0I own Axe14/Vale15 horse stud, where I breed, sell, buy and rescue all kinds of horses!§0
§0So, at my farm, I'm selling URUs. Just keep in mind that
Page 2: the URUs are the most rare horse in Mutts. At the minute, there are only four of these horses that exist. I own two of them, my friend owns one and another friend owns another.§0
§0I am selling these horses for 25k each. If you are good with§0
§0animals and
Page 3: horses, I may cheapen the price for you!§0
§0If you have another rare horse, like one with a huge amount of hearts, a huge jump high or that goes really fast. I will halve price to 12,5k. That's if you will give me that horse; or the offspring of that horse.
Page 4: Regular horses: 75 mums each§0
§0Race horses: 125 mums each§0
§0Showjumping horses: 150 mums each§0
§0Skeleton horses: 200 mums each§0
§0Donkeys: 50 mums each§0
§0Mules: 100 mums each§0
§0Ultra Rare Undeads: 12.5k/25k each
Page 5: If you want us to look after your horse, we will! All you have to do is: Message me (if online) or drop us a message in the donations box at Axe15/Vale15 horse stud. /visit Vale15 or Axe14 and simply follow the signs and torches!
Page 6: We take great care of your horse, will train and even take out for frequent rides (if wanted).§0
§0Keep in mind that you don't have to give us permition to ride your horse.§0
§0Here is the time/payment times below!
Page 7: 1 day: 25 mums§0
§01 week: 75 mums§0
§01 month: 200 mums§0
§06 months: 400 mums§0
§01 year: 1500 mum§0
§0So basically 25 mums per day, I will be counting how many days your horse stays with us, and when you come and collect it, I will add up the days and tell
Page 8: you the bill!§0
§0
§0Thank you very much for reading this short article about WolfGirl1901's Axe14/Vale15 horse stud.§0
§0
§0Please re-sell this book for 150 mums!

"""""""""""""""""""""
My friend the Pigman
Lives in the nether like the rest
With a Golden sword in his hand that he loves to curess
As long as I don`t hit him I know ill be fine
Zombie or pig he just can`t decide
His flock of fellow 
Page 1: pigman follow closely

And will proceed to attack me if i hurt any of them at any time
But i know ill be safe as long as I stay in line
My friend the pigman is always on my mind

"""""""""""
Dashing to my home and I won`t look back
for there is something following me that wants to attack
Its long black arms stretching to reach me
and its purple particles seek to beseech me
Its as tall as 3 block 
Page 3: and has purple eyes
and screams very loudly when it catches me in its sight
Teleporting towards me is its greatest power
No matter where I am it will catch up at any hour
No matter how much i want to i cant look back
Page 4: For the enderman oh the enderman is on the attack 

%TheBatKid100%
Page 5: Shhhhhh!
"""""""""
Shhhhh is the sound it makes when its ready to blow
And it is pretty much almost everyones foe
Its green with no hands thank notch for that
So that it cannot hold you and keep you from running back
Page 6: There is nothing more saddening than when it appears
And destroys your greatest creations that you love so dear
But one day ill kill it and take its head as a keeper
Anything to rid myself of that annoying creeper

	Author: SuperBobHero
	Type: Written

Page 0: Hello this will be a story about a fellow called the enderman. Lets get started. Once upon a time, I was walking around at night and I kept hearing a hissing sound. At first I thought it was a creeper about to blow up, but then my mind changed as I spun 
Page 1: around. It was a creature that I had never seen before. This mob was a peacful mob. Then, some noob player came out of nowhere and hit the beautiful creature. Then the beautiful creature attacked and killed him. I named this creature the Enderman. I named
Page 2: this specific enderman Jack. He was awesome, he loved my jokes, loved my games, he loved trolling people the most.This friendship would never break up! Well, I was wrong about that. 20 years later... Jack became Enderlord. I took the place of Notch. 
Page 3: Whenever I tried to visit Jack, the guards said that he's busy. Whenever Jack tried to vist me, I told him I was busy. Soon enough I stopped visiting him, and he stopped visiting me. Then, our friendship broke apart. about 40 years later, I had found out 
Page 4: that he died. I was so brokenhearted that I died of sadness.

§0Hi, this is WolfGirl1901.§0
§0I know we all got off to a wrong start.§0
§0Snorelax12 didn't get your message, I did.§0
§0I will inform her of your "sorry".§0
§0We do wish for you to not cause trouble and to call people mean things.
Page 1: But it can't be helped that we were mean too.§0
§0Please remember that if you feel you can say sorry to us when we're online, please do.§0
§0Snore and the rest of us are not happy.§0
§0We have resulted to placing traps and hiding our animals so 
Page 2: they cannot go through the same fate as the ones who were killed.§0
§0However,§0
§0I do know that you have been kicked out of many villages, you don't deserve that.§0
§0But you didn't follow any of Sanford's rules that are there
Page 3: to protect people and animals, plus make Sanford a lovely place to live.§0
§0And when I logged on this morning, you were in the village. I didn't say anything because I was wondering what you were doing.§0
§0I saw the message and read it. But you did leave
Page 4: the gates open, which is asked not to do in the rules.§0
§0Anyway,§0
§0I accept your appology but the others might not.§0
§0Until they do, please stay away from the village and try not to cause any trouble, that way they will be more likely
Page 5: to accept you.§0
§0Good look with everything.§0

	Type: Written

Page 0: My good sir I write this letter, to tell you of me plight,
For at the time of writing I am not a pretty sight,
My hunger bar is empty my hearts a deathly grey...
And I write this note to tell you why I'm not on Mutts today.
Page 1: Whilst working on survival some tickets I had to do,
Fixing these kids problems without half of a thank you,
The kid was not pleased with my work he was an awful sod,
He said I took his diamonds and had committed fraud.
Page 2: Now I tried to clear things up before we came to blows,
But I had not expected that he'd try to me depose,
In my haste to clear things up he cried abuse at me,
And we argued in the morning till half past fucking three.
Page 3: So when I finished fighting with this stupid cad,
I noticed in my inventory some mail that I had,
A message from a loyal fan I was so pleased to see...
Until I saw it was some noob with a griefed-up fucking tree.
Page 4: Well I fixed the stupid grief and get ready for me bed,
When suddenly a loud blast rocks me fucking head,
I turned around suddenly and to my dismay I see...
Someone covered my house in five hundred tnt!
Page 5: Well when I saw this crater I knew what had transpired,
NRH sat giggling like a fucking child,
I sighed annoyedly and began to roll back the area...
When suddenly I was attacked by my terrier.
Page 6: Now the force of this collision knocked the laptop from me lap,
but by this point in the day I could hardly give a crap,
I reached down beside me chair and was enraged to see...
The server had only gone and crashed unexpectedly.
Page 7: Now normally I wouldn't care much about this anomaly,
But when I returned my house was still made of tnt!
I thew my laptop on the floor and the screen did then crack,
unfortunately taking with it my entire fucking back.
Page 8: The force of the collision from the laptop to the floor,
had caused my chair to tumble and hit my decor,
I sat in a pile of wires and broken glass,
But when I tried to get up I landed on me ass.
Page 9: Dazed and with no computer left to use, All the lights in my house then blew a fucking fuse.
Stumbling around in the dark it should be clear to see...
Why I can't attend the fucking meeting on teamspeak.

Step One: Play MuttsWorld for a while

Step Two: Buy Diplo

Step Three: Get Ambassador (you usually have to be 13+ for this)
Page 1: Step Four: Prove yourself to be a worthy moderator (You usually have to be 18 for this)

Step Five: Make an application to show your interest.

Note: You will not always be fit for a staff position and may not get a promotion.
Page 2: Also, I am not staff myself (except on skyblock), and reading and following these steps will not promise staff, its simply a basic guide for those who do not know how the system works.

Page 1: What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? Ill have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and Ive been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills.
Page 2: I  am trained in gorilla warfare and Im the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth,
Page 3: mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the
Page 4: storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. Youre fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and thats just with my bare hands.
Page 5: Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit.
Page 6: f only you could have known what unholy retribution your little clever comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldnt, you didnt, and now youre paying the price, you goddamn idiot.
Page 7: I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. Youre fucking dead, kiddo.

	Title: Survival Re-done
	Author: Fawneh1359
	Type: Written

Page 0: I was suddenly missing survival a bit, so I decided to redo this. However, I don't want to continue or redo here. Cuz...let's face it, this house sucks. So, I used a lot of mums to look through four /random regions and one of them looked pretty good. It's
Page 1: Lava1. It was a gravel mountain biome, with the region post RIGHT below the clouds. There were 3 lava pools RIGHT outside the post, and a big lake too. So water and lava is covered. There are not many building around, I don't think. We can build up so it 
Page 2: can be big and tall and epic xD. I wanna build right next to spawn :P The one problem is, I have to read about gravel biomes cause i'm not sure about their resources. I plan for everyone to set region there, since house will be next to region, and then 
Page 3: have /home somewhere else where there are resources (Or the other way around, depends). Everyone will have to vote daily, too. My current warps:
Here, storage, zombie spawner, skeleton spawner, swamp (slimes), and one in a jungle for jungle wood. The warp
Page 4: here will stay, spawn and forest will stay. Spawners, I'm not sure if those will stay or not. Maybe one of them...prob skeleton. But yeah. The house plans: I think we will have like wood walls and stone brick for floor. We shall see I guess. All in favor 
Page 5: say Meow on the board. All in favor say aye, all opposed say nay. Vote on the board and sign your name. I need to see who is still with us. I think it's only Whisper, Solar, Guests, and I think Wolf. :/ But yes, let me know if you are still here. :/ 
EDIT
Page 6: [EDIT] Okay, 5 lava pools right around spawn O.o Also, the region is apparently gravel plateau, which makes sense. Btw, I died to find out this stuff. We need to build stairs here.. Also, the region right next to it is dirt with snow blocks and ice on top
Page 7: It's called Ice Mountains, and it is seperated with a river. So yah, lemme know what you think.

[Verse 1]
Dog goes "woof"
Cat goes "meow"
Bird goes "tweet"
And mouse goes "squeak"
Cow goes "moo"
Frog goes "croak"
And the elephant goes "toot"
Ducks say "quack"
Page 1: And fish go "blub"
And the seal goes "ow ow ow"

[Pre-Chorus]
But there's one sound
That no one knows
What does the fox say?

Big blue eyes
Pointy nose
Chasing mice
And digging holes
Tiny paws
Up the hill
Suddenly you're standing still

Your fur is red
So beautiful
Like an angel in disguise
But if you meet
A friendly horse
Will you communicate by

Mo-o-o-o-orse?
Mo-o-o-o-orse?

Ancient mystery
Somewhere deep in the woods
I know you're hiding
What is your sound?
Will we ever know?
Will always be a mystery

You're my guardian angel
Hiding in the woods

Page 0: Dear Slendy911,
I was thinking. And concluding. And then thinking some more. I thought "What about a sky town?". We'll start small. First just a single house, as a sort of base of operations, where we can move a lot of supplies to. It can be the house I
Page 1: showed you, the medieval one. It has nice storage, is made of eaily obtainable resources, so when we build the rest of the town, it won't be expensive as frick. Then we'll expand. Make a town hall island, a shop island, and a few houses. Finally, we could
Page 2: build more residential buildings, put a warp at the town hall, and have people liveing there for money! It would take a few weeks, but the end result will be very satisfying. This is to be a long term goal. Tell me what you think of it!


Next page ->
Page 3:              Sincerely,
             Hero

P.S.
We could move there ourselves, and sell the houses we live in right now. BTW ill make a modified version of my house for you to live in.

Page 3: Prologue
[3 Minutes Before]
 Twas 3 minutes before it all came down. I was sitting on the couch sweat beaten wearing nothing when I heard it coming. It opened the door, and turned out to be Puar. It came with a thrust all over my bust. 
Page 4: [Present]
I saw the Meteor flying down, ready for impact, and knew I had to stop it. I planned slowly and carefully, aligning my mouth perfectly to it. There was sweat on my chin when the red throbbing meteors head landed in my mouth. I knew this would be
Page 5: too much for one person to handle, as it was nearly 4 inches from the ground. The Meteor picked a target of it's taste, a busty tan girl with brown hair, that goes by the name of nrokin. It thrusted back and forth, and I had to act quickly if I wanted to 
Page 6: take down this meteor. I quickly pulled out my tracfone while battling this beast and texted my best friend Vic. You could describe her as very pale, but not as busty, with beautiful hair. She hurried over as fast as she could to help take down this
Page 7: meteor before we could put more people at risk. Victoria and I battled for the head of the meteor, trying our best to take turns, although the meteor kept beating us with it's stick, trying to tell us that it only has a couple of minutes left. That only
Page 8: meant we had to work harder and harder to take it down, and that's when it happened, the meteor exploded into a giant white shower of amazingness all over our faces, and we licked off eachothers faces, spitting it into eachother's mouths. We then finished
Page 9: it off by swallowing. They then spend the next hour or so entertaining themselves in ways TehSabbingSlayer would have enjoyed. They know it won't be the last meteor, so they will always be ready to take down another together, otherwise the whole
Page 10: world is at risk. The tale ends with two bare women feeling accomplishment in their life, very happy with the award they earned. Who knows how many meteors they will have to take on during the weekend...

Page 1: §9Prologue:

§0Despite the downpour, Chaos boldly ventured on into the woeful valley of
blackened elms.

The sopping sounds of his splashing feet echoed into the still,
rain-drenched woods.
Page 2: The burdens he bore were great, not only those on his
back, but those of the heavy toll of sin on his soul.

Everyone. Not a single peasant spared. He mused over his decision to kill
everyone that looked like the damned.
Page 3: "Perhaps my judgment was too harsh. Yes, that woman really meant no harm."

He chuckled in remembrance of the mass slaughter in the peaceful hamlet.
Chaos was a hearty paladin-cow.
Page 4: He didn't stop to think as he systematically purged
the entire town. Penance must be paid. He was on a spiritual quest to cleanse his sins he had done in the company of the alluring man mage, Zhalfir.
Page 5: §2Chaper 1

§1§5-Seven weeks ago, the hour of the tendercrisp bacon elf sandwich.

§0
Page 6: Leaning on the banister of the dwarven trade ship, Chaos saw the mage's mighty tower from at least three fortnight's walks.

The knight-errant Chaos had received an ultimatum from the Dwarven Council.
Page 7: The council were the rulers of the kingdom Stoutshmeckle.

Chaos was a simple man-cow; a mercenary with a fancy title, and was by no means a hero. He sported a draping moustache, his bedraggled hair the typical burly brown of his highland homeland.
Page 8: His armor was of modest leather and iron, and by chance an unadorned steel cap sat atop his head.

No true knight was he.

His equipment consisted of a sturdy black mace and a round shield adorned with a blue spiral.
Page 9: An ample sack covered his cape, full of whimsical odds and ends necessary for survival in the world in which he resided.

The nights were long and the days were hot, but in time the sea voyage met its end.
Page 10: Upon arrival, Chaos strolled off of the gangway and onto solid ground.

The wind whipped up from the grey ocean as he beheld the impressive edifice in its full glory.
Page 11: Grim clouds slowly whirled about the top of the looming structure, as if by some magical force, perhaps.

He trundled toward the base of the tower, and shambled up the incline to the entrance.
Page 12: Chaos paused upon the last step on the top of the cascading stairway that led to a somber, shale door set in the base of the stupendous monolith.

A feeling of doubt
washed over him,
quickly being shook
away, knowing he must
press on.
Page 13: He forged his iron will anew into steel and reached for the goblin shaped knocker on the left of a similar, troll headed one.

He recoiled in horror when the statue's eyes rolled about madly.
Page 14: "Wahts we got here Eliott?" the sentient copper goblin giggled.

"I thinks its fresh meat for the master." squealed Eliott the troll head.
Page 15: "Shat-tap, bitch. You sound like a shrieking milkmaid who's just seen a barewolf!" retorted the goblin.

"What say you, you magical trickeries and metallic neon-eyed fiends?" probed Chaos.
"Am I not entitled to enter the man-mage's tower?"
Page 16: "Oh, certainly," replied the goblin. "But we are only here to forewarn the supple fools who Master lures in. Secure your ass plate, noble knight! For Master desires manflesh more than anything these days.

But business is business, so says I.
Page 17: So enter, but remember us well.

For we are the only pair of knockers you'll ever see in this tower! Hee Hee!"

The two copper beings parted to the sides as the gates swung open.
Page 18: Chaos set forth in determination. He passed through the foreboding entrance and came upon a crossroads.

Three halls diverged, marked by troubling, leering gargoyles. The left probed deep into the innermost clutches of the burly ground. 
Page 19: The one ahead consisted of a seemingly endless hallway. The rightmost path led up a mesmerizing staircase.

Chaos' keen snout sensed a moist wind emanating from the spiral staircase.
Page 20: Knowing that the master wizard, Zhalfir could only exist in a solid state in sopping climes, he turned and began to ascend the staircase.
Page 21: 'Ware the seductions of Master," the goblin echoed from behind. "Even the straightest arrow can be bent!"

After the warning, Elliott let loose a squeal that sounded a little bit like a fire hose sprayed through an electric fan filled with pelicans and -
Page 22: whistling track coaches who had a little too much time on their hands and liked to play tug of war behind the snack shack but one day the tennis kids came by and tipped it over, subsequently trapping them in the tomblike waste wallow and he hated his life
Page 23: and all the days after no one looked at him quite the same way, not even his family and that's what Elliott's scream sounded like.

Chaos ventured deeper into the labyrinthine halls. As he progressed, he began to fall into a dreamlike state.
Page 24: The winding corridors seemed to shift as inexplicable enigmas danced within his primitive manbrain.

His rhythmic footsteps were punctuated by mysterious sounds; sudden soft laughter, or the quiet shutting of a door.
Page 25: He felt a singular sense of disquiet as he strode ever quicker down the corridor, fighting the trancelike waves of unreality.

He was suddenly aware of a vast presence behind him, and he whirled around.
Page 26: Shield set and mace drawn back, but nothing was there, and Chaos began to doubt his own sanity.

§6(Certainly it wasn't
there in the first place because he kills a shit load of innocent people.)
Page 27: §0Then a notion arose. Perhaps Chaos was not really wandering the halls, not even moving. Gods!

He was wandering within his own mind! He must get back to consciousness right now, lest he wake up with a sore ass.
Page 28: He struggled through the blurring mire of the dreamworld, trying to reach out for consciousness.

Finally, with all of his will, he snapped back awake, and found himself in a dim, velvet room.
Page 29: His armor covered in rose petals, but thankfully still on.

A story of a little ol' cow in a cowless world.
-----------------
2013 Best Novel of the Year

Critics say it's the most touching story in muttsworld history

"It made my cry with my eye!" -Mumblerit
Page 1: CHAPTER I
The Little Cow's beginnings
----------
Early on during my time on the world of Mutts, there was always the occasianol message in chat. It read:

§4§6Zhalfir §6Rocketed §6XxChaosIncxX
Page 2: At the time, Zhalfir was a moderator. Along with Smokey and Rickhanschen, he was one of the first mods I met and got to know. Chaos was a wee little Diplomat at this time. Rememvber kids, this was when Diplomat was cool. Lifetime diplomat was only $60 and
Page 3: you could even get access to /heal with arrow tp!

I always though of Chaos as the cow in a suit that sat around spawn. Let's fast forward an update to 1.6 beta. Nether portals work in SMP! Bad news. This caused errors with our 
Page 4: Nether added by plugins. Any chunk west of spawn with a Nether Portal was destroyed, entering the chunk kicked you for "Internal Server Error". It was horrible, my first home in the little village under Smokey's railroad was demolished. Trezi's farm was
Page 5: destroyed and Sim's Tower split in half. Although, we rebuilt. I noticed some construction going along over on what used to be to the right side of the West road. It was the beginning of a build by Chaos. It later turned out to be a subway station to go 
Page 6: with Smokey's railroads, but it never took on. About a quarterway through construction, with OJ FOR MOD messages flying through global, Chaos' moderator application was accepted! From there on, he was now the flying cow in a suit with that odd little blue
Page 7: spot on his head that could now fix every problem and rocket Zhalfir back.
Page 8: Chapter 2
Cow Problems
------------
Now you see, Chaos was very lonely on this map. Why? Well cows were disabled very simularly to how squid were disabled not too long ago. They were loud and didn't drop anything so they were useless to us.
Page 9: Now at the time, Cows still existed in chunks unloaded since the disabling, but were extremely rare. We would go on hunts for cows, and some would never adventurers would never be seen again. Obviously, you can tell Chaos was quite lonely because all of 
Page 10: his brethren are gone. One day, I went on the hunt for cows. I found absolutely nothing. To cheer Chaos up, I posted a picture on the forums titled "I finally found a cow on Muttsworld!" and in the spoiler contained a picture of a smiling cow. It only
Page 11: made Chaos cry.
Page 12: CHAPTER 3
The Future of Cows
------------
Well, we kind of just jumped five to six months in the future. It's september eighteenth, 2011. What signifigance is this date? Why it's the 1.8 update! 
Page 13: Well, we didn't really update until the twentieth when the bukkit build came, but when it did, we set up a multiverse world to have the old map and new for transferring builds and items. I was in teamspeak at this time in a channel with all the populars. 
Page 14: We went through the portal together and build a temporary platform where the portal brought us. At here, we continued to fuck around and eventually recorded "Muttsworld Circle Jerk" with ToxicKandy. 

http://youtu.be/mWhAqciaQaI
Page 15: At this time, cows had been re-enabled for about a month and a half and they also now dropped beef. Chaos cherished all of his brothers and set up a protection agency for cows. That part didn't really happen, but have some imagination.
Page 16: CHAPTER 4
END OF THE COW?
--------------
It's around summer of 2012 I believe, I was very inactive around 2012 so I do not know the specifics of the story.  

I assume it went something along the lines of...
Page 17: Chaos and Mumblerit were pig jousting. Chaos kicked Mumblerit's ass. Mumblerit demoted Chaos in a fit of rage.

Anyway, I'm tired and don't want to finish this novel. I forgot to mention his part in Aspen, Ravenwood's battle of the 
Page 18: silverfish. Let's list stuff.

Chaos had creative mode and perms to abuse after demotion.

Chaos is a badass.

Chaos has X's following his name which makes him automatically cool.
Page 19: Yrahoz and I milked Chaos for his special milk and sold it at Mutt's Item Dump.

Chaos was the first to test collecting milk from players in disguise as a cow with ojmt. Oj's efforts were useless.
Page 20: Chaos is in a group of players including myself who played before we would even get 55+ players at prime playing times.

He's a cow in a suit with an eyepatch and a blue spot on his head.
Page 21: He banned my Timebirds account for "I'm afraid the lemur got into the pudding cup" It was just for fun, but it messed up and got the account banned for a couple of days because the pardon didn't work with MCbans.
Page 22: I remember your treehouse with dont worry be happy or whatever their name was.
Page 23: PS. Zhalfir is a sandwich.

PSS. Skyler smells

[Verse 1]
Dog goes "woof"
Cat goes "meow"
Bird goes "tweet"
And mouse goes "squeak"
Cow goes "moo"
Frog goes "croak"
And the elephant goes "toot"
Ducks say "quack"

And the seal goes "ow ow ow"

[Pre-Chorus]
But there's one sound
That no one knows
What does the fox say?

Big blue eyes
Pointy nose
Chasing mice
And digging holes
Tiny paws
Up the hill
Suddenly you're standing still

Your fur is red
So beautiful
Like an angel in disguise
But if you meet
A friendly horse
Will you communicate by

Page 0: It was a dark night when it happened....§0
§0I can remember it so clearly as if it were yesterday.§0
§0
§0July 2nd 2008, my parents were murdered in cold blood.... "How did it happen?" said the policeman to which I had not replied to.
Page 1: "Jesus christ... We are getting nowhere with this." he finally said.§0
§0"Bloody hell... just take him to the Orphanage."§0
§0A few minutes later I found myself in a large building with some not so glad children. Apparently this was my new home.
Page 2: About a Month later I found myself adopted by a couple of nice individuals who I later found out to be abusive. §0
§0Before I go about this a little bit more, My name is§0
§0Alexander Cross§0
§0at present time I am aged 34 recently out of prison.
Page 3: The deceased abusive parents who I shall not name in respect for the dead gave me a scar on my back which was conviently in the shape of a long cross down my spin and across below my shoulder blades which I have come to like alot. A few months later I
Page 4: escaped with blood on my hands at the age of 16. I burned the house in fear of being caught for murder. Eventually I got a job... Not the job I was expecting though....§0
§0
§0End of Prologue
Page 5: Chapter I§0
§0The Tramp§0
§0
§0 I met a strange fellow during my what had now slowed down from a run to a stroll. A poor looking man who I had stopped a bit to take a gander at. He had strange tattoos on which I had never
Page 6: seen before, very exotic and a look as which they seemed to have a bit of history.§0
§0 The man had looked my way and asked if I had any spare change§0
§0I gave him what change I had left and thanked me. Then he said something I'd not expected...
Page 7: "I can see the the blood on your hands lad." I replied being very startled "What do you mean sir?"§0
§0"Don't play coy with me lad, I could report you to the constables"§0
§0"Forgive my tone but you are but a simple tramp-" He cut me off "More than a tramp lad."
Page 8: I was intrigued now.§0
§0"Really now. Care to explain sir?"§0
§0"A good mannered boy eh? Not what I'd expect from a new murder" he replied and chuckled softly for a while. He then said that he was part of a secret order that predated long ago... I only laughed
Page 9: at the tramp in dismay.§0
§0He didn't take this well and simply struck me somewhere on my neck.§0
§0My vision grew dim and I slipped out of consciousness.
Page 10: Chapter II§0
§0A New Life§0
§0
§0 I woke up in a strange new place filled with various peieces of art and fine decorations. What had caught my attention was the giant crest above what I assumed to be the main door. I glanced around and found
Page 11: the old tramp in the corner.§0
§0"How in blazes did you get me here?" he simply laughed and replied "I have my ways." He tossed me a wooden sword and said "I want you to try and strike me down with that." I looked at him very confused.
Page 12: "For the love that is all and holy just do it." I laughed at him and swung at him. to my suprise he had blocked it with his walking stick and disarmed me with a swift strike to the wrist and pushed me to the ground. I simply looked at him in amazement.
Page 13: He helped me up and said to me "You have a dark past, I can see it in your eyes, I know you want revenge and who wouldn't when your parents were murdered?" I looked at him astonished, he chuckled slightly and said "I want to train you Alexander in the art
Page 14: of stealth and murder..." I stood there for the longest time in silence "You can leave if you want to, however just think of the sweet revenge..." I sat there a little while and finally came to a decision...§0
§0"I'll do it."
Page 15: Chapter III.§0
§0Training§0
§0
§0 The training was brutal, it was as if the tramp could see everything. I was never able to sneak up on him, I was forced to climb up mountains bare foot. But for some strange reason... I enjoyed it.
Page 16: I enjoyed the stinging pain and relished every moment of it. I eventually started hunting animals under his guidance and became quite self sufficient. He taught me everything he knew until the incident...
Page 17: Chapter IV§0
§0Betrayal§0
§0
§0 I couldn't fathom it... My final trial as I called it.§0
§0 After all I went through. I wanted to think he was proud of me. But no... It was only a rouse... One night he looked at me with a murderous stare.
Page 18: I realized what was happening as a group of men bearing the same tattoo appeared. "Hello apprentice! Glad to see you're still here." I hid my fear and said "What do you mean?" "Well... We have a contract to collect... It's your head." I stared at him in
Page 19: shock and disbelief.§0
§0They each pulled out swords, sharpened and ready for bloodshed. One of them charged at me yelling a feral sound, to my suprise I managed to dodge the sword and struck him across the face. He recoiled back and stared at me in disbelief
Page 20: and charged at me again.§0
§0 This time I hopped backwards and grabed the nearest object. when he grew near I sidestepped and struck him on the back of his head with a Lantern. He died with glass in the back of his head and most of his face charred.
Page 21: I picked up the sword and gave my master the same murderous glare he gave me and said "Does anyone else want to try?"§0
§0Everyone except the Tramp charged at me swords shining from the light of the fireplace. I parried one of them and stuck my sword through 
Page 22: his chest and threw him at another one of the men. The other three tried to attack me at the same time and I simply moved out of their way and they fell into eachother and crumpled to the floor. Again i looked at the Tramp and asked,§0
§0"Why are you doing
Page 23: this"?§0
§0The Tramp simply said,§0
§0"Finish them off"§0
§0Without a hesitation I picked up one of their swords and slammed it down through the neck of anyone still conscious.§0
§0"Good." The Tramp said softly. "This was your final test, you are worthy to become one of 
Page 24: us."§0
§0"Us?" I asked.§0
§0All of a sudden, I could see shadowy figures creep out of the darkness of that poorly lit room. One of the figures said,§0
§0"We have watched your progress very closely. We welcome you to our Family."§0
§0Another spoke and said,
Page 25: "Go now and rest, we will call upon you when we need you."§0

	Title: Halloween Part 1
	Author: sikur7

Page 0: It was October 30th 2005 when all of the kids were preparing for their joyful night of Halloween the next day. Jenna and her 3 friends Anna, Leslie, and Sherry were all going to dress as cute cats together for theyre senior highschool Halloween party.
Page 1: The next day came, Halloween. The party started at 6:00pm and Jenna and her friends were ready hours before frolicking in exitment around Jenna's house.The girls decided to go out early and grab a bite at the Ruyard Diner.
Page 2: Then 6:00 rolled around and the girls arrived at the party. All of the girls friends and classmates were all there, nerdy bill, Jered the jock, and Chealsy the cheerleader. The girls partied and partied like there was no tomorrow untill it was about 2am.
Page 3: Jenna and her friends were bound to party all night untill 3am when the music starts scratching and everyone gets a bit uneasy. Everyone countinues talking with eachother in hope that the music will come back on untill they head a loud bang.
Page 4: Everyone jumps a little and looks around a little and then another *BANG!* everyone is even more frightened then *BANG!* once more, almost everyone is ready to leave in fright then *BANG!* *BANG!* *BANG!* three in a row that makes 5.
Page 5: Lesie found 5 broken glasses on the floor next the the table with the punch on it. Now no one even cared about the party anymore they just wanted to leave. About half of the party leaves but Jenna and the girls stick around just to find 6 other glasses 
Page 6: broken on the floor on the other side of the punch table, that makes 11. Sherry said that she read in an article that if 11 things are broken that means there is a demon in the presence. The girls were all freaked out by now and decided to head home.
Page 7: They all got in Jenna's car and started to drive down Gorlend road down to Jenna's house and the girls decided to sleep at Jenna's. They start to heat shuffling in the back and agreed to look when they parked. once they walk over to the trunk they fill 
Page 8: with a bad feeling and a voice telling then something is going to happen. Anna opens the trunk very slowly and shakely and see a body of a woman to have looked as if she was in her early
20's.

Page 0: Hai,

Okay so I bet you are wondering, "Why is our room like 50x bigger?"

Well, our room was getting smaller so i made it bigger! You guys can do whatever you want to fill the space, i rlly don't care. And I also made a balcony (near where u 2 slept)
Page 1: So you can also do whatever you want there too. 

I used some of the glass panes in the chest we all share. I also use some birch wood from there.

And Jamie,
When I came back from afk, a zombie was attacking me so I started to hit it and then I accident-
Page 2: -ally 1 shotted your dog. So I left a name tag, 10 bones, and pink dye in the chest
:)

You can move your beds if you dont like them where they are, I just thought you both wanted to be near each other like the old arrangement. 
Page 3: idk what else to say but the window with the blue wool, water, and flowers. Don't mind that. I needed to put a window there and it was in a mountain so I improvised and made it look like the outdoors! I think I did a good job ;)

ANYWAYYYYSSSS..
--->
Page 4: Yeah, that's all I can think of that I changed...


xoxo,
Sammi Grier ;)

=================== 24? Potion of Leaping
25? Negative Potions
26? Potion of Poision
27? Potion of Weakness 28? 
Page 4:      Introduction
=================== Welcome to potion brewing! If you're new, keep in mind that you need a brewing stand, glass bottles filled with water, and many ingredients, which vary depending on what type of potion you may want to create.
Page 5:      Introduction
=================== Every brewing stand has the capability to hold at maximum three bottles at a time, meaning you can make 3 potions for every single ingredient you add. Keep this in mind!
Page 6:   Base Ingredients
=================== These ingredients start all potions.
------------------- ?Nether Wart
?Glowstone Dust
?Redstone
?Fermented Spider Eye [Adding these to a water bottle will create a base potion. see page 11]
Page 7: Secondary Ingredients =================== ?Magma Creme
?Sugar
?Glistering Melon
?Spider Eye
?Ghast Tear
?Blaze Powder
?Fermented Spider Eye

[Increases duration]
?Glowstone Dust
[Increases potency]
?Gunpowder
[Turns into a splash]
?Fermented Spider Eye
[See next page]
Page 9:   Effect Corruption
=================== Fermented Spider Eyes will change a potion's base effect, often reversing it or producing a negative potion. A "corrupted" potion usually does the opposite of the original potion.
Page 10:       Base Potions
=================== Base potions, much like base ingredients, are the basis of all potions. These are the potions created by simply a watter bottle and a base ingredient together.

§0   §3§lINTRODUCTION§0
§0===================Welcome, reader! In this book, we will be discussing very basic German conversational skills. Please note: This book will §cNOT §0Fully teach you German.
Page 2: §3§l    NON-ENGLISH§0
§3§l      LETTERS§0
§0=================== If you're going to learn German, even basic phrases, there are 4 special characters you have to be aware of. 3 of them are what we call Umlaute. Umlaute are either an A, O, or U with 2 dots.
Page 3: §3ä§0: This character sounds very close to pronouncing the English letter A in the alphabet. (§aAYY§0), although it has less of a twang to it. Instead of pronouncing with a Y sound on the end, try saying "eh?"
Page 4: §3ü§0: With the U umlaut, things get more difficult. Try making an E sound, as in the word §6Me§0. While making this continued EE sound, curve your lips dramatically, like you're kissing someone or making an U sound. 
Page 5: §3ö§0: Like the U umlaut, combine the U sound with an English A. As in the word §6bay§0. While making this A sound, curve your lips, the sound produced should be a U umlaut.§0
§cPlease use Google for this part, it's very difficult to describe on-paper.
Page 6: §3ß§0: This is an Eszet. Make sure not to mistake it for a B, as it's pronounced nothing like it. The eszet is basically a short way to write a double s in German.§0
§0Example:§0
§6Füßen§0, a short way to write §6Füssen§0. §0
§0(§6Feet§0, in English.)
Page 7: A few other things to note about pronounciation of German letters:§0
§0===================§6W§0: Pronounced exactly like an English V.§0
§6V§0: Pronounced exactly like an English F.§0
§6J§0: Pronounced like an English Y. Example:§0
§0Ja = Yah.
Page 8: §6R§0: Google this one, too. It's pronounced very much like a French R, a gutteral sound from the back of your throat.§0
§6Z§0: Pronounced like an English TS. As in Pan§6ts§0. For example, Zehn (ten) is pronounced like Tsayn.
Page 9: Just like in English, groups of letters will make certain sounds together.§0
§6sch§0: Pronounced exactly like an English SH. Example: Tschüss!§0
§0would be pronounced like tshooss. (It's similar to saying Cheers! to a friend.)
Page 10: §6eu§0: Pronounced like an English -oy, as in the word b§6oy§0.§0
§6äu§0: Exactly like the EU, it is pronounced like -oy.§0
§6ie§0: Pronounced like an English ee, as in B§6ee§0.§0
§6ei§0: Pronounced like the English letter I, as in NEIN!
Page 11: §6-ch§0: The infamous flem, like you're coughing up a hairball. I'd recommend Googling this one, too.§0
§6-r§0: When an R comes at the end of a word, like a British accent, it is not pronounced. Example: Besser is pronounced like Bessah.
Page 12: §cth§0: This one is in red because it is NOT pronounced in German like in English. There is not a TH sound (like in the) in German. A TH together is simply pronounced like a T.
Page 13: Keep in mind that silent letters are almost nonexistant in German! Often you will find E's on the end of words, these are pronounced like (uh), like you're thinking about something. (uhhhh)§0
§0Example: Bitte is pronounced bit-tuh
Page 14: Now, on to what you came here for! Phrase-learning!§0

§a§l   CHAPTER ONE§0
§0===================It was a cold day. I warmed my gloves by the fire, hoping that perhaps we'd have an extra set of rations tonight. This was a fool's dream, however, and we all knew it.
Page 2: Despite the brutal conditions and heavy casualties, things were starting to look up. We were quick to relax, as we'd been fighting all through the day. Tjaden suffered a cut to the thigh, seemingly caused by a serrated edge.
Page 3: We cringed at the thought of the wound, as Tjaden slept on one of the only three straw beds we had available for the wounded. The rest of us made camp on the floor. Before drifting to sleep, I began thinking of home.
Page 4: This was a mistake of course, as no soldier should ever dream of home, with its high-rolling green meadows, of its warm breeze against their skin. And especially a soldier should never dream of his parents.
Page 5: It's often good to think of home, but never to create such brittle fantasies, such thin memories, as gentle as a spiderweb. It seemed so foreign to me, it's been 3 years since I slept in my own bed, at home.
Page 6: I often missed my dreary existance in civilian life, but I had grown old in the war, despite my young age. §0
§0
§0It was a glorious day, when we signed up...§0
§0
§0What sweet memories that made...
Page 7: 
§a§l   CHAPTER TWO§0
§0===================I had made haste that morning. I had a usual routine of groggily walking down the stairs around noon, when the sun was high in the sky, still rubbing sleep out of my eyes. Today was different.
Page 8: I awoke at approximately 8:00 sharp, readied myself for the day and set off at 8:30. I can remember it so clearly, yet anything else is fogged, as if someone is heavily breathing on the glass of my mind.
Page 9: I met with my friends from school, readying myself for the careful examination of the combat teacher. Tjaden stood at full attention, as if he was born for no reason other than to battle. Bäumer stood at his best ready position, also, but it was apparent 
Page 10: that he was not yet trained. Pünkte and the other recrutes stood on their best behavior, ready for training. I, however did not want to join the military, and it apparently showed.
Page 11: "Hold fast, recruit! What is your name?"§0
§0"Friedrich" I replied sheepishly. I had not anticipated to be called out in this manner. §0
§0"And what is your last name? The one that matters."§0
§0"Uh... Gärtner, sir!"
Page 12: "And why was your reply late, may I ask? Is this truly your name?" He asked, obviously toying with me.§0
§0"Yes, sir!" I replied, embarrassed. He barked at a few of the recruits in an aggressive tone, but after 3 or 4 of us, he gave up.
Page 13: After hours of physical training and marching-drills, we finally got our rest. It was good, there was plenty of food and beer, and everyone was in a jolly mood, having made it past basic selection.
Page 14: 
§a§l CHAPTER THREE§0
§0===================We awoke early for the next 2 months. The same cycle every day. Wake up before dawn had even broken, run drills for 6 hours, eat, and rest soon afterwards.
Page 15: This continued for nearly half a year, with small breaks in between for Christmas and other holidays. It was not so bad, we were only a village away from my home, so on holidays, I would return to visit my family.
Page 16: Eventually the day came. We were given our field-kits. A cheaply-made iron chestplate which made an amusing *klang!* noise when we jumped, a sturdy set of boots, and a tought set of leather pants.
Page 17: The boots were not so bad, in fact they were quite comfortable to wear around the base camp. The chestplates were clearly made on a whim, by some Bavarian factory-worker looking for a quick buck. They'd stop nothing more than a stick.
Page 18: The leggings were the worst of all. It seemed half of our had come from the frontlines, pulled off of dead soldiers. Bäumer's had a clear cut through the knee-cap, with a suspiciously crimson-red stained left leg. We soon decided that it was clearly not
Page 19: a jelly-stain, as the commander had stated. We had to undergo more training while wearing our field-gear and fencing with wooden swords. Two days after recieving our 'armor', our swords arrived.
Page 20: Tjaden was for once the luckiest of the group. His sword was a finely attuned, Swedish made blade. If you had told us that it was forged yesterday, we all well would have believed it. My blade looked worn and used. It was chipped heavily about the
Page 21: hand-guard and lower blade section. A few men traded blades, though it wouldn't matter much. It was based on opinion. We were told that we would move out in 3 days. Of course, when we heard this, we all left soon afterwards to say goodbye to our friends.
Page 22: 
§a§l  CHAPTER FOUR§0
§0=================== The day had come. We arose at 6:30, the commander was generous enough to give us a half hour's more sleep.
Page 23: I grabbed my pack, and we were rationed loaves of bread and tough sausages of pork. We polished off our sausages and saved the bread for later. Most of us, at least.
Page 24: As we were walking, our breast-plates clanking amidst our marching, our mis-matched swords strewn carefully in the sheathes of those fortunate enough to have one on their battle-worn leggings, it became apparent that we were not well prepared.
Page 25: It seemed as though every day, more and more countries joined in on the meaningless war, and that we were the least prepared of all of them. We were told to set up our camp around an open field, amidst a forest. We managed to do so by about sunset.
Page 26: We finished what little stale bread we had, passing our spare to those who had not been so careful with their rations. As I looked around, passing the heel of my loaf to another soldier, I realized that we may have been ill-prepared, but what we lacked
Page 27: in individual equipment, we made up for in numbers. We were only one regiment of the 20 sent onto the field in the past week, and us alone was 120 men strong. This reasurred me, but it was tough to sleep. We were told of an ambush from the
Page 28: French coming tomorrow. We acted to one another as if there would be no such ambush, but inside, we all knew what would meet us in the morning.
Page 29: 
§a§l  CHAPTER FIVE§0
§0=================== We awoke earlier than usual, likely before 5:00 even. It was dark as the night we struggled to sleep in previously.
Page 30: We all looked around, trying to let our eyes adjust. Pünkte came prepared, however. He pulled a torch and a fire-starting kit from his knapsack. He lit the torch, and it went up like a tiny volcano on the end of a stick. We covered our eyes for a few
Page 31: seconds, as it was very bright. §0
§0"You there!" Hollered the commander§0
§0"Snuff that torch! Do you want them to all know where we are?"§0
§0Cursing under his breath, he quickly extinguished the torch in the mud laid below our tent.
Page 32: We sat in silence for quite some time. We could almost see the sun coming up when we hear the yelling of what sounded like 1,000 men. They trampled the ground, and made us tremble.
Page 33: In the cover of darkness, they ran for us, and it was evident as to why they were so loud. Many of them rode on horses, firing arrows towards us at high velocity.
Page 34: A few of our men charged forward, but it was no use; they were quickly struck down by the better-equipped French cavalry. Many of us stood in place, wide-eyed at what was happening, forgetful to what had been mentioned the night before.
Page 35: "Hold your ground!" Yelled our commander. "Let them move to us!" Hollered a recruit from another section of our regiment, whose voice I recognized not. 
Page 36: The French continued their rush towards us, yelling the whole way, and it felt as though time itself came to a halt. We still stood in awe until a French swordsman got close enough to be beheaded by a sergeant from our regiment.
Page 37: We had heard nothing but stories of courage about the war. Nothing but knights in their shining armor, bucking their horse as its mane fluttered in the wind. This was nonsense. When someone is put in a position we were all facing,
Page 38: all emotion is lost. Everything we had trained and trained for had been forgotten. We fought only for ourselves. From the air it must have looked like someone tried to merge oil and water, clear-cut line drawing its way down the battlefield.
Page 39: It continued for long into the afternoon. Five of us stuck together in a group amidst the chaos of the combat. Bäumer, Tjaden, Pünkte and I stood in a close formation, along with another man whose name we did not know.
Page 40: A few squads came rushing towards us, and Tjaden was the first to strike. His blade dug into a man's midriff, and was stuck in his shoulder. I was watching until I was hit across the face with the hilt of a dagger. Bäumer grabbed the man's arm and forced 
Page 41: him to stab himself with his own dagger. I finally snapped out of my shell-shocked surprise, and realised what was happening. Three more men came towards us. I swung at one, but he was quick. He jumped backwards, but unfortunately for him, his friend was
Page 42: close beside with a lashing strike, which dug into his side. He fell with a yelp, his friend's sword buried in him. I was quick on the draw, and swung from the top downward onto the now weaponless man. He tried to dodge, and I hit him in the shoulder. 
Page 43: His arm came clean off, and blood spurted like water from a pump. It was gruesome, but at the time I was fighting for one reason and one reason only: survival. I swung sideways, decapitating him. His head rolled to the floor, as another lunged at me.
Page 44: I barely managed to raise my sword in time to parry his strike, and it was barely effective, to say the least. He stumbled backwards, into Pünkte, who gladly finished him off with a cut to the throat. This type of horrible warfare continued until late in 
Page 45: the evening. At that point, we had all been scattered across the field, finishing off the last of the French with our heavy broadswords. Their cutlasses were no match in an open environment.
Page 46: I hit a man backwards, and he fell under an injured horse. He was trampled in front of my eyes, and I fought the urge to throw up. I turned and looked at the field, now soaked thoroughly in blood. Our band of friends gathered quickly afterwards, stepping
Page 47: over the disfigured corpses. Bäumer had taken a cut to the left arm, one he would live through with no problem. Tjaden and I remained unscathed, at least physically. Pünkte had not been so fortunate. He lay with his eyes open, unblinking, soaked in a pool
Page 48: of his own blood. Many men lay about us in the same fashion, both French and German, but the sight of a dear friend in such a condition was heart-wrenching. Soon afterwards, the commander requested each squad leader take a head-count and report to him.
Page 49: We would have done so, had our leader not been dead. We tallied our squad. What was once 12 men was now a sorry group of 5. The commander came soon with the total. What was once 120 men was now 70. It was not a good day.§0

Page 4:      Introduction
=================== Welcome to potion brewing! If you're new, keep in mind that you need a brewing stand, glass bottles filled with water, and many ingredients, which vary depending on what type of potion you may want to create.
Page 5:      Introduction
=================== Every brewing stand has the capability to hold at maximum three bottles at a time, meaning you can make 3 potions for every single ingredient you add. Keep this in mind!
Page 6:   Base Ingredients
=================== These ingredients start all potions.
------------------- ?Nether Wart
?Glowstone Dust
?Redstone
?Fermented Spider Eye [Adding these to a water bottle will create a base potion. see page 11]
Page 7: Secondary Ingredients =================== ?Magma Creme
?Sugar
?Glistering Melon
?Spider Eye
?Ghast Tear
?Blaze Powder
?Fermented Spider Eye
?Golden Carrot

Page 8:         Modifiers
=================== Add these to a potion to alter their effects. -------------------?Redstone
[Increases duration]
?Glowstone Dust
[Increases potency]
?Gunpowder
[Turns into a splash]
?Fermented Spider Eye
[See next page]
Page 9:   Effect Corruption
=================== Fermented Spider Eyes will change a potion's base effect, often reversing it or producing a negative potion. A "corrupted" potion usually does the opposite of the original potion.
Page 10:       Base Potions
=================== Base potions, much like base ingredients, are the basis of all potions. These are the potions created by simply a watter bottle and a base ingredient together.
Page 11:    Awkward Potion

       Base of:
-------------------?Potion of Weakness
Page 14:     Effect Potions
===================Effect Potions are any potion that can be used to add any sort of effect onto a player. There are both positive and negative effect potions, both of which can give advantages in combat, or even in building or mining.
Page 15:    Positive Potions

§0
§0  I start my journey here. It'll be a long trip. I'm in search of some civilization where I can settle for the night. I won't be anywhere near my house and won't look back until I return successfully.
Page 1: Day 2§0
§0
§0   I have found civilization! It's not much, but it's pretty new. There's a big wooden house, a smaller stone brick fort, and some crops. I hope there is still a sign of human life here.
Page 2: Day 3§0
§0
§0   That base sure was cool! It had a lot more than I thought. Nothing I could use. Sadly, no human life there. Must've been abandoned.
Page 3: Day 4 §0
§0
§0   I have found the sea! It looks very vast, with no land in the distance. It'll be uncertain to me wether I will find my way back or not. I might have to say goodbye to my home in the mesa. Well, here it goes...
Page 4: Day 5§0
§0
§0   No way. I have found a strange ancient underwater temple. It is made of strange turqoise bricks and stones. I hope there aren't any mean fish people in here.
Page 5: Day 6§0
§0
§0   Sadly, I could'nt get into the temple. The fish people were hostile and didn't like visitors. There were many human skeletons down there. I got a little freaked out and left without hesitation. Well, back to my journey...
Page 6: Day 7§0
§0
§0   It's great! I found another one of these ancient underwater temples, but there were no fish people guarding it! Somebody had been here before and aired it out, which made it alot easier to gather some samples of the rock to study...
Page 7: Day 8 §0
§0
§0   Well, I'll just start by saying that I have returned home. What an adventure that was. It was a pleasure to right this journal for whoever would be joyed to read it.

	Title: The Loss
	Author: Kaevman
	Type: Written

Page 0: Day 1

  As my old proccesors start to work again and come onnline, I realised that I am not in my old wonderful Kaevhouse anymore.... I can't find my beloved wife anywhere... or my piglets. I became confused.
Page 1: Day 2

  I have found a new freaind that I can adventure out through this harsh new land. the landscape is new and fresh so I beleived that god did something terrable to the land. I miss my diamonds, my piglets, and mostly my wife.
Page 2: day 3 
   My freaind Luis epic and I always lose each other, because its so hard to navigate. but we find each other again by following our voices, eventually we find a sea that we decided to boat over but our lack of communication got us lost for a day.
Page 3: day 4 
   I still havent found Luis epic but this gorgous land is impossible to miss, I never have seen so much unsettled land.
Maybe this isnt such a bad thing...
Page 4: Day 5
   I found Luisepic and brang him over to a possible 2D house build.. it didnt end up being entirely 2D. I start realising how much I lost... my amazing farm.. my amazing collections...
evening clothes battle clothes and pajamas... *sigh*
Page 5: Day 6
   I made some evening clothes but I still miss all my stuff.. I miss my pet chicken... My tree in the bedroom.. my cool looking farm... my staircase that leads to numerous useful rooms... my mooshroom.. my survival basement.. my escape hatch...
Page 6: What god took away:
my entire house, I worked hard and long trying to make it last, My bedroom, my bedroom looked like something i would want to sleep in in real life, My wife, My beutiful pig wife, My mooshroom, I cannot live without.
Page 7: What god gave us:
A new land of oppertunities.
Page 8: NOTE FOR LUISEPIC:
day 50 (lost count)

I am fed up with this I realised that I have lost something that was the most dearing to me besides of everything in this entire god damn world! My last real bone..
Page 9: STORY:

After scientists tested on me I was left with one real bone.. it was the only bone that was left not inceniratedfor me to keep. The rest of my bones where replaced with steal and that bone ment alot to me.
Page 10: FINAL:

  Im moving to the nether where it is beleived where the pigs from the last world where sent to. I do not know why wont I count as one but i will go where I belong. I also hate god so i will go to a non god reined world.

[Verse 1]
Dog goes "woof"
Cat goes "meow"
Bird goes "tweet"
And mouse goes "squeak"
Cow goes "moo"
Frog goes "croak"
And the elephant goes "toot"
Ducks say "quack"
Page 1: And fish go "blub"
And the seal goes "ow ow ow"

[Pre-Chorus]
But there's one sound
That no one knows
What does the fox say?

Big blue eyes
Pointy nose
Chasing mice
And digging holes
Tiny paws
Up the hill
Suddenly you're standing still

So beautiful
Like an angel in disguise
But if you meet
A friendly horse
Will you communicate by

Page 4:      Introduction§0
§0=================== Welcome to potion brewing! If you're new, keep in mind that you need a brewing stand, glass bottles filled with water, and many ingredients, which vary depending on what type of potion you may want to create.
Page 5:      Introduction§0
§0=================== Every brewing stand has the capability to hold at maximum three bottles at a time, meaning you can make 3 potions for every single ingredient you add. Keep this in mind!
Page 6:   Base Ingredients§0
§0=================== These ingredients start all potions.§0
§0------------------- ?Nether Wart§0
§0?Glowstone Dust§0
§0?Redstone§0
§0?Fermented Spider Eye [Adding these to a water bottle will create a base potion. see page 11]
Page 7: Secondary Ingredients =================== ?Magma Creme§0
§0?Sugar§0
§0?Glistering Melon§0
§0?Spider Eye§0
§0?Ghast Tear§0
§0?Blaze Powder§0
§0?Fermented Spider Eye§0
§0?Golden Carrot§0

§0?Rabit's Foot

§0?Gunpowder§0
§0[Turns into a splash]§0
§0?Fermented Spider Eye§0
§0[See next page]
Page 9:   Effect Corruption§0
§0=================== Fermented Spider Eyes will change a potion's base effect, often reversing it or producing a negative potion. A "corrupted" potion usually does the opposite of the original potion.
Page 10:       Base Potions§0
§0=================== Base potions, much like base ingredients, are the basis of all potions. These are the potions created by simply a watter bottle and a base ingredient together.

Page 0: §0§0This is the Deadly and Tragic tale of Mr. Whiskers The Cat of Death.
Page 1: §0§0A Man walked through a forest alone with a bottle of vodka. He was quite into it too so he was very drunk as he stumbled over rocks and sticks. As he continued to struggle through the forest he heard a odd and loud Meow in the distance.
Page 2: §0§0As he continued towards the annoying noise it kept geting louder and more odd sounding. Until he discovered a kitten sitting in a pile of sticks. The kitten was mostly black fur although their was some diffrent colors around his legs.
Page 3: §0§0The kitten stared at the man it had also stopped meowing entirely. Drunk as he was the man still remembered how much he hated cats so he continued to throw sevrel sticks and rocks on top of it thinking the kitten could never escape and would die slowly
Page 4: §0§0The man laughed to himself for a good minute before he dropped his bottle. He quickly retrieved it of course but to his suprise when he looked up the kitten was there stareing at him. This confused the man because he was sure he trapped the kitten earl
Page 5: §0§0The man cursed at the kitten in rage of how stupid he felt at the moment. The cat then said to the mans suprise. "Such a lovely set of words you have said. please continue" The man quickly screamed and fell backwords.
Page 6: §0§0To the mans suprise the kitten was on his chest within seconds looking into his eyes. while peering into them the man couldnt help but feel fear as he heard whispers all around him and throughout the forest. The cat continued to stare without speaking.
Page 7: §0§0The Man came to his senses soon and tried to get up only to find he lacked the strength as the kitten dug its claws into him and said. "No no §0no...not§0 so §0fast...you§0 and me have a few things to discuss." 
Page 8: §0§0The Man struggled much more feeling the claws begin to burn into his skin as the kitten spoke. "You think you can just kill a innocent cat in the woods and that nobody would miss §0it....its§0 just another pointless animal to you."
Page 9: §0§0"You think that i wouldnt have survived §0that.....well§0 sir...a word from the §0wise....when§0 you try to kill §0something........make§0 sure its really dead" The Man then felt only cold as his vision faded and the kitten soon walked away satisfied w
Page 10: §0§0"Oh and §0sir.....do§0 me a favor and tell them Mr. Whiskers sent you. They will have a good laugh at that"
Page 11: §0§0Nobody has seen the kitten sense then. but in the forest there are still some tiny §0pawprints....and§0 the occasional dead §0body....flayed§0 and §0mutilated....left§0 to §0rot..with§0 claw marks at its chest and claw and teeth marks on their throat.
Page 12: §0§0Wherever he went its always obvious he still lurks somewhere in the §0jungle.....Because§0 you know....

so the wolf has to left everything he loved and go to find a new home

leaving this place behind

Once there was a wolf living in the sky.

the skyblock server was a peaceful place to stay, so the wulfy made a home
Page 2: it rendered as smooth as it could be and had not much

but what he had was enough to live a peaceful progressive life
Page 3: he thought he was all alone until he changed his settings to far and noticed he was not alone

far away there were little homes at equal distance each one from another

with people leaving the same way...
Page 4: as the wolfy was leaving 


as an eternal grid above the eternal void

A tale of tragedy, written to the sounds of collecting spiders, by Ticklepushy.
Page 1: For my lover, girl of farts.  You are my lover, girl.
Page 2: Chapter One

The day began as any other, with the overwhelming aroma of farts and dog breasts trumpeting from the cast iron stove, downstairs.  As much as William wanted stay curled in the fetal position, dreaming of the devil pulling his
Page 3: eyeballs out of their sockets, he couldn't help but wake, wretching at the sulferic smell coming from the kitchen.  William looked down at his slippers.  'William Schafer Shaves' the embrodiment on them read.  Did his dad really have to brand his boy's
Page 4: name onto everything he owns!?  You lose two lousy cochlear implants and everybody acts like you threw three-hundred grand down the toilet, or something.  William didn't flush them down the toilet.  He lost them while making them battle down at
Page 5: Shane's Pond.  Dad's just don't understand battles!  And it isn't William, DAD, it's Cool Daddy Big Shades, Cool Daddy Big Shades would say to himself.
And that smell of farts and dog breasts that never lets him sleep?  Twas farts and dog breasts.  Dad's
Page 6: just don't know how to cook, either, he guessed.  Cool Daddy Big Shades put in his nose plugs and popped a fews 'Chewie Bois', a popular stomach relief tablet for kids that came as a gummy.  A growing boy's still gotta eat, he always said.
Page 7: Chapter Two
?
Cool Daddy Big Shades watched as his father foolishly brought the spider eyes to his mouth, his eyes transfixed on the newspaper.  Cool Daddy Big-- er, wait a minute.  Did you miss something?  Hm.. yeah,
 you did.  Curse these
Page 8: budget books!  Well, I'll paraphrase: Cool Daddy Big Shades decided to vocalize his disagreement with his father's food.  Yadda yadda yadda, and here we are:  His father bit into the spider eyes without even wincing.  Herbert always had been a hard fellow
Page 9: as any bloke brought up in a padgonian POW camp should be expected, but his sense of smell- curse his false nose!  His threshold for pain was so high, it was a superhero caliber disability in of itself, so of course it was his cheap, Korean nose, cast of
Page 10: shanty plastic, that would offer the final betrayal.  "You've fed me spider eyes, boy.  You have done me," his father hissed.  Big Shades replied with an unempathetic sneer "I thought they were turtle-berries, carried from upstream.The dog brought them to
Page 11: me."   "Of course," cried the boy's father, "the dog!"
Herbert began convulsing on the floor as the life drained out of him, tick by tick.  Big Shades stood over his father, who could blink and little more.  "Twas I who made councious offerings of spider
Page 12: eyes, to you, father.  And now I will marry my mother and devour my kin with dodgechester's sauce."  "I knew it was you, boy.  And now, I'm going to tell the family."  And with that, his father stood up and began to strut out of the house like nothing had
Page 13: happened.  "How could this be," postulated Big Shades, "Kimmy McKinny at day care swore that spider eyes would be lethal and Doctor Gregor Shaun Isenhowerz, director of the Institue for Advanced Future Health at John Hopkins University had corroberated
Page 14: that story.  What about the corpse in the study!?"  His thoughts were swallowing him in an avalanche of perpetuation.  "Wait a minute," he said really loudly, to himself.  "The dog!"   Indeed, the dog had fooled the household, once again.  His fiendish
Page 15: motives, riddling and unclear.  They'd tried torturing it out of the Mutt, years before, but his literall inability to 'talk' prooved a sinister trate they would learn all dogs carry.  All dogs, except 'Sammy, the self-aware, talking dog' that the
Page 16: government discovered and destroyed before anyone ever found out. 
On cue, the dog shimmied into the room.  He had found that the most frightful gate for a calculating dog, was that of hankey-pank shimmy.  Nothing disturbed a human more.  That coupled
Page 17: with the unshakeable reality that the 'boot scootin boogey' had run it's course.  The dog's lips quivered in a ghastly motion, like that of the wavey frills on some deep sea entity, cascading with rainbow iredecency.  The grandest of nature's spectacles
Page 18: are reserved for the merciless and the uncaring.  That was the profound irony in nature, the dog found.  The collective destitution of his fellow dog and man could never be complete without a ruling group of people, to show them what they don't have. 
Page 19: The dog knew this well and still, he sought to be of the choosen.  His dillusion was diliberate and far reaching, but in a world where treaty snacks, too are reserved for the well endowed, it was something that he could call his own.  The family could
Page 20: steal his spirit from under him, but they never could have his mind.  "You lied to me, dog."  Cool Shades couldn't hide the hurt on his face.  "And now Dad's gonna go and tell everyone what I did!"  "Bow wow wow bow bow," the dog retorted.
Page 21: Cool Shades had heard enough.  He grabbed the dog by it's tail and swung it about in a fashion one might expect from a very angry dog catcher, or other dog hating type.  The dog was not afraid, having navigated via his dreams, for many years 
Page 22: the Rzzilie River, in the Democratic (clearly) Republic of the Congo.  The dog released a mere poot from it's behind and the boy was stunned beyond all surmountability.
"You have done me, dog," Cool Shades said to his pooch, as if to ask "why?" "You did
Page 23: yourself, dear boy," the dog muttered back.  Cool Shades starred, stunned.  Had the dog-- had he just talked?  Or was it the blood leaving his body?  William Shafer Shades lay dead in a puddle of his own dribble.  The flatulence of his dog a formidable
Page 24: opponent, indeed.  The dog lit a cigerette and chewed at it's naval for a bit.  A victorious nawing was well earned.  Another night alive.  Another enemy with a face that smells of defeat and spit.  Another fragment of hard candy that turned out to be a 
Page 25: dry pea, resulting in a shattered tooth.  He figured an intervention may be in order, but you need thumbs to kill yourself, properly.  And then SHE came in and she was naked... naked under those clothes.  Those layers and layers of clothes.  So many
Page 26: layers of clothes, in fact, that she could have been characterized as an individual who cared very deeply for many layers of clothes.

far away there were little homes at equal distance each one from another

with people leaving the same way...

Tekkit home


by Black Dewn
Page 1: Once there was a wolf who explored another world

it was full of lots of unknown objects


he quickly fell in love with the marble block with which he built a fancy but tiny home
Page 2: 
it even had a pool for the relax time close the spawn, and he was happy with the technology around


to continue...

(this is a replica of the real thing on the now vanished Tekkit server)

Maze tower


By Black Dewn
Page 1: 

Once there was a wolf who wanted to look everything around.

the view was so beautiful and charming that he wanted to be the only one able to see it
Page 2: 
so he twisted everything inside making it all like a maze


...
not everyone has been able to admire the same view since then

§0§0=====================
Page 1: §0§0This book is just for you to know a little bit more about my history with Mutts.
Page 2: §0§0I guess I'll start if off from when I first joined, I joined on July 5 2014 which my plan was to build a Lab (Which I have accomplished)and to somehow play a important role in the community. Everything for me started off great until I broke some glass 
Page 3: §0§0because I didn't want to use the front door to get out the building (Lazy and Silly me).§0
§0§0Because of that, I almost got banned by Rain but I promised that I will never do it again and from that day I never broke glass ever again. That wasn't suppo
Page 4: §0§0the moral of the this, but It seems a lot like. Anyway, to show my forgiveness, I built a Giant 3D Potion on a Mountain for Rain. After that nothing really happened until I met NRH. I still remember that day like it happened yesterday, funny though, I 
Page 5: §0§0became friends with her by saying in ServerWide "NRH is love, NRH is life". We talked a bit and I met Brooke, who I met on §0Plug.dj§0, and she introduced me to ZCS, ShellyTurtle, Bambam, and Fjogur. And I'm pretty sure I became part of their crew beca
Page 6: §0§0hanged out with them all the time. They showed me how be helpful, which then I never helped anyone because I was too busy doing my own boring things, and I thank them for that.  After those days, I went out on my own and met my partner in crime, 
Page 7: §0§0Liebelegof. We made a lab and such, however, I noticed the drop in ambassadors so I started taking the role of helping chat, which was enjoyable considering I didn't really talk/help in global that much, and I gained a passion of helping people.
Page 8: §0§0Finally, here I am, an ambassador on Survival. It is very entertaining since I get to help player full time. What I love most about doing it that I get to meet new people, learning more things about them, and making them happy at the end of the day.

Page 0: okay so I mean ik you dont care and stuff but like I want to tell someone and I think you will just understand the most and so like i'm really confused and sad because I've always intensely loved declan and stuff but ya know its online so you cant really 
Page 1: do anything but I tried to keep it going and always talk to dec and make sure we always loved each other but you know dec and stuff he never really like talks or anything so its really hard to be 'close friends' but like for two weeks we havent like sat
Page 2: down and had a good traditional conversation so its kind of sad but i always try to instigate one but it never works out so I guess I just gave up...? so yeah I gave up aaaand I mean I dont want it to be like this but I've done too much to make it the way
Page 3: it is, but he never really did anything so yeah
I gave up
the end
bye
sorry I just needed to explain
but now I dont like anyone cause I feel like no one wants to play with me cause
Page 4: I'm just the annoying little ambassador girl that cant even control her own caps and I thought being staff would help me with all my mod friends but it seems worse cause all the mods do is hang out with each other and I feel excluded all the time
Page 5: so anyway I'm really sad the end

Page 1: §0§0Whilst working on survival some tickets I had to do,§0
§0§0Fixing these kids problems without half of a thank you,§0
§0§0The kid was not pleased with my work he was an awful sod,§0
§0§0He said I took his diamonds and had committed fraud.

§0§0But I had not expected that he'd try to me depose,§0
§0§0In my haste to clear things up he cried abuse at me,§0
§0§0And we argued in the morning till half past fucking three.
Page 3: §0§0So when I finished fighting with this stupid cad,§0
§0§0I noticed in my inventory some mail that I had,§0
§0§0A message from a loyal fan I was so pleased to see...§0

Page 4: §0§0Well I fixed the stupid grief and get ready for me bed,§0
§0§0When suddenly a loud blast rocks me fucking head,§0
§0§0I turned around suddenly and to my dismay I see...§0
§0§0Someone covered my house in five hundred tnt!
Page 5: §0§0Well when I saw this crater I knew what had transpired,§0
§0§0NRH sat giggling like a fucking child,§0
§0§0I sighed annoyedly and began to roll back the area...§0
§0§0When suddenly I was attacked by my terrier.
Page 6: §0§0Now the force of this collision knocked the laptop from me lap,§0
§0§0but by this point in the day I could hardly give a crap,§0
§0§0I reached down beside me chair and was enraged to see...§0
§0§0The server had only gone and crashed unexpectedly.
Page 7: §0§0Now normally I wouldn't care much about this anomaly,§0
§0§0But when I returned my house was still made of tnt!§0
§0§0I thew my laptop on the floor and the screen did then crack,§0
§0§0unfortunately taking with it my entire fucking back.
Page 8: §0§0The force of the collision from the laptop to the floor,§0
§0§0had caused my chair to tumble and hit my decor,§0
§0§0I sat in a pile of wires and broken glass,§0
§0§0But when I tried to get up I landed on me ass.
Page 9: §0§0Dazed and with no computer left to use, All the lights in my house then blew a fucking fuse.§0
§0§0Stumbling around in the dark it should be clear to see...§0
§0§0Why I can't attend the fucking meeting on teamspeak.

The chill,
Sneaks through the window sill,
If you are not warm you pay a bill,
In turn for being ill.

Has something to spare,
The smell is hiding in the atmosphere.
Hold on tight,

Page 3: Prologue
[3 Minutes Before]
 Twas 3 minutes before it all came down. I was sitting on the couch sweat beaten wearing nothing when I heard it coming. It opened the door, and turned out to be Puar. It came with a thrust all over my bust. 
Page 4: [Present]
I saw the Meteor flying down, ready for impact, and knew I had to stop it. I planned slowly and carefully, aligning my mouth perfectly to it. There was sweat on my chin when the red throbbing meteors head landed in my mouth. I knew this would be
Page 5: too much for one person to handle, as it was nearly 4 inches from the ground. The Meteor picked a target of it's taste, a busty tan girl with brown hair, that goes by the name of nrokin. It thrusted back and forth, and I had to act quickly if I wanted to 
Page 6: take down this meteor. I quickly pulled out my tracfone while battling this beast and texted my best friend Vic. You could describe her as very pale, but not as busty, with beautiful hair. She hurried over as fast as she could to help take down this
Page 7: meteor before we could put more people at risk. Victoria and I battled for the head of the meteor, trying our best to take turns, although the meteor kept beating us with it's stick, trying to tell us that it only has a couple of minutes left. That only
Page 8: meant we had to work harder and harder to take it down, and that's when it happened, the meteor exploded into a giant white shower of amazingness all over our faces, and we licked off eachothers faces, spitting it into eachother's mouths. We then finished
Page 9: it off by swallowing. They then spend the next hour or so entertaining themselves in ways TehSabbingSlayer would have enjoyed. They know it won't be the last meteor, so they will always be ready to take down another together, otherwise the whole
Page 10: world is at risk. The tale ends with two bare women feeling accomplishment in their life, very happy with the award they earned. Who knows how many meteors they will have to take on during the weekend...

STORY WRITTEN BY

INSPIRED BY THE CRUSHES OF HER PAST

ALL CHARACTERS ARE FICTIONAL AND DO NOT REPRESENT REAL PEOPLE //


Page 1: REVIEWS:

Still a better love story than twilight - Everyone

5/5 Would Finger to again - 80% of lesbians

Muttsworld Lesbian Erotica 2013 Award
Page 2: Audrey was a tall, long-haired brunette with brown eyes and the face of a goddess. She was everyone's dream. Unfortunately for the male population this woman was blessed with the curse of being a lesbian. Countless men and women were dumbstruck by her
Page 3: looks. The dominate, aggressive, Audrey had no preference for men. She enjoyed taking submissive women and turning them into her playtoys for the evening.

Audrey went to a coffee shop to get coffee. What the hell else would she get at
Page 4: a coffee shop? Condoms? NO. However, there was this cute girl named Sofia. She had a soft-round cute face. One you could fuck all night to.

Now that we have the two main characters in the scene. Let's get to the hot and sexy part. The shower....
Page 5: LLOOL JK WHO HAS SEX IN A SHOWER.

So, the two warmed things up nice and sweet with a shower. Some cute cuddling standing up and fondling tits and washing each other. As they are about to get dirty so I don't know why they didn't save
Page 6: the shower until after. Audrey gets tired after sex don't judge her.

Sofia lays down naked on the bed and Audrey is not slow to lay ontop of Sofia's wet naked body. Sofia and Audrey were both athletes so they had nice hot bodies.
Page 7: Hot too look at, not hot to touch atleast not until they started to fuck.

Things got hot.

The bed sheets melted.

The house caught on fire.

No bodies could be
Page 8: found in the charred remains of their hot, steamy, sexy, sex.

LOL JK that would be horrible. SO let's focus back onto the bed.

Now, I'm sure we all know what happens when to lovely lesbians get together
Page 9: in a bed. So, i'll spare you the details.

I'm sure your head can do the rest of the work. Add some strapons or only use one. Or two. Ten. Kinky shit man. Not litterally. 

The End.

§0Do not sell or copy without authorization. Any attempt to do so will be met with legal charges.§0
§0

Page 1: Foreword:§0
§0
§0This book is not a story, nor is it meant to be. It is a log. At least, that's what it was meant to be. The original log was created by the same "author," puppyuppy (the same author of THIS log), but the previous one was, unfortunately, 
Page 2: destroyed in an explosives accident. The original had taken place over 140 days, each one carefully documented. The one you are currently reading should, hopefully, take place over a longer period of time. However, in deviation from the first one, ALL 
Page 3: days will be recorded, as oppossed to being skipped over when it is seen as "uninteresting" or "boring."§0
§0
§0So, without further delay, the log will begin!§0
§0
§0Enjoy
Page 4: Day 0 - Gathering§0
§0
§0Before embarking upon my journey, I need to gather supplies (as any good explorer would do). I will need a compass, sword, shovel, pickaxe and an axe. Though some of these might seem uneeded, they all have uses in the long run.  Ah, but
Page 5: where are my manners? My name is puppyuppy, and I am to embark on a journey to map the lands that will eventually be transformed into bustling residential, business, and industrial sectors. Each of these areas will eventually become a part of a group of 
Page 6: cities and towns, known as The Kingdom of the Ender. I'll spare you the details of it, probably because you've never heard of it. But, to put it bluntly, it's an organization of people who work independently, but function under a single ideal belief: that
Page 7: all the buildings that people work on are monuments to the End Gods, and that all who oppose such ideas are not worthy of believing in any Gods. However, the Kingdom is sparing enough to keep them alive, for they believe that unjustified killing is wrong.
Page 8: If you ask me, they're just a bunch of hippies who believe in a bunch of nonsense. I mean, if the ender dragon is their god and it can be killed, then it's not much of a god, is it? §0
§0Now, you might be thinking§0
§0"But, Pup! You're exploring for these guys!"
Page 9: Well, dear reader, I do realize that. However, if I am to make a living off of my exploration, then maybe It would make sense to get some money off of it. §0
§0
§0Back on topic, the supplies I'll be needing aren't too difficult to come by, but I'd like to have 
Page 10: them in the highest possible order. If I don't, then I can kiss my dream of exploring goodbye. So, I've made myself a new sword from diamond, and are on my way to enchant it.§0
§0That is, if I had enough experience.§0
§0So, off to an experience farm it is!
Page 11: But which one? Well, I suppose xpgrinder will do; it has all the essentials for getting experience, and a little bit more. §0
§0
§010 MINUTES LATER...§0
§0
§0After a brief trip, I had determined that the old grinder hasn't been in too good of a shape, really. So, I
Page 12: instead take off to xpfarm, hoping for some actual experience points (not that I didn't get any).§0
§0
§05 MINUTES LATER....§0
§0
§0Well, it appears that THAT experience didn't net me ANYTHING. So, I instead take off to Cube, HOPING for at least ONE drop of 
Page 13: experience.§0
§0
§010 MINUTES LATER...§0
§0
§0I have managed to get to 15 levels, but the spawners at cube won't but it. So, instead, I warped to PoweredWorld (or was it PowerWorld?). Upon arriving, I was greeted with a surprise: A slime spawner!
Page 14: I seized the opportunity to get as much slime as needed for possible demands. Not only will I have a form of currency in the Kingdom, but I will also have experience levels that will benefit me greatly! Thank goodness for warps.§0
§0
§015 MINUTES LATER...
Page 15: At last! I have gotten 30 experience levels! Now, I can finally gain the sword that I will require to journey through the wilds of Muttsworld! Off to the enchantment rooms!§0
§0
§02 MINUTES LATER...§0
§0
§0And finally, the blade itself! I have decided to call it.....
Page 16: "Prophets Wisdom"§0
§0
§0Makes sense for the journey I'm embarking upon. §0
§0
§0Now, a few more supplies to acquire, and I'll be all set.

	Author: XxChaosIncxX
	Type: Written

Page 0: §9Prologue:

§0Despite the downpour,
Chaos boldy ventured
on into the woeful
valley of
blackened elms.

The sopping sounds of
his splashing feet
echoed into the still,
rain-drenched woods.
Page 1: The burdens he bore
were great, not only
those on his
back, but those of the
heavy toll of sin on
his soul.

Everyone. Not a single
peasant spared. He
mused over his
decision to kill
everyone that looked
like the damned.
Page 2: "Perhaps my judgement
was too harsh. Yes,
that woman really
meant no harm."

He chuckled in
remembrance of the
mass slaughter in the
peaceful hamlet.
Chaos was a hearty
paladin-cow.
Page 3: He didn't stop to think
as he systematically
purged the entire
town.
Penance must be paid

He was on a spiritual
quest to cleanse his
sins he had done in
the company of the
alluring man mage,
Zhalfir.
Page 4: §6Chapter 1

§5-Seven weeks ago, the
hour of the
tendercrisp bacon elf
sandwich.
Page 5: Leaning on the
banister of the
dwarven trade ship,
Chaos saw the Mage's
mighty tower from at
least three fortnight's
walks.

The knight-errant
Chaos had recieved an
ultimatum from the
Dwarven Council.
Page 6: The council were the
rulers of the kingdom
Stoutschmeckle.

Chaos was a simple
man-cow; a mercenary
with a fancy title, and
was by far no means
a hero. He sported a
draping moustache, his
bedraggled hair the
typical burly brown of
his highland homeland.
Page 7: His armor was of
modest leather and
iron, and by chance an
unadorned steel cap
sat atop his head.

No true knight was he.

His equipment
consisted of a sturdy
black mace and a
round shield adorned
with a blue spiral.
Page 8: An ample sack covered
his cape, full of
whimsical odds and
ends necessary for
survival in the world in
which he resided.

The nights were long
and the days were hot,
but in time the sea
voyage met its end.
Page 9: Upon arrival, Chaos
strolled off of the
gangway and onto
solid ground.

The wind whipped up
from the grey ocean
as he beheld the
impressive edifice in
its full glory.
Page 10: Grim clouds slowly
whirled about the top
of the looming
structure, as if by
some...magical force,
perhaps.

He trundled toward
the base of the tower,
and shambled up the
incline to the
entrance.
Page 11: Chaos paused upon
the last step on the
top of the cascading
stairway that led to a
somber, shale door
set in the base of the
stupendous monolith.

A feeling of doubt
washed over him,
quickly being shook
away, knowing he must
press on.
Page 12: He forged his iron will
anew into steel and
reached for the goblin
shaped knocker on the
left of a similar, troll
headed one. 

He recoiled in horror
when the statue's
eyes rolled about
madly.
Page 13: 
"Wahts we got here
Elliott?" the sentient
copper goblin giggled.

"I thinks its fresh
meat for the master."
squealed Elliott the
troll head.
Page 14: Shat-tap, bitch. You
sound like a shrieking
milkmaid who's just
seen a barewolf!
Page 15: "Oh, certainly," replied
the goblin. "But we are
only here to forewarn
the supple fools who
Master lures in.
Secure your ass
plate, noble knight! For
Master desires
manflesh more than
anything these days.

But business is
business, so says I.
Page 16: So enter, but 
remember us well.

For we are the only
pair of knockers you'll
ever see in this tower!
Hee Hee!"

The two copper beings
parted to the sides as
the gates swung
open.
Page 17: Chaos set forth in
determination. He
passed through the
foreboding entrance
and came upon a
crossroads.

Three halls diverged,
marked by troubling,
leering gargoyles. The
left probed deep into
the innermost clutches
of the burly ground.
Page 18: The one ahead
consisted of a
seemingly endless
hallway. The rightmost
path led up a
mesmerizing staircase.

Chaos' keen snout
sensed a moist wind
emanating from the
spiral staircase.
Page 19: Knowing that the
master wizard. Zhalfir
could only exist in a
solid state in sopping
climes, he turned and
began to ascend the
staircase.
Page 20: "Ware the seductions
of Master," the goblin
echoed from behind.
"Even the straightest
arrow can be bent!"

After the warning,
Elliott let loose a
squeal that sounded a
little bit like a fire
hose sprayed through
an electric fan filled
with pelicans and -
Page 21: whistling track
coaches who had a
little too much time on
their hands and liked
to play tug of war
behind the snack
shack but one day the
tennis kids came by
and tipped it over,
subsequently trapping
them in the tomblike
waste wallow and he
hated his life
Page 22: and all the days after
no one looked at him
quite the same way, not
even his family and
that's what Elliott's
scream sounded like.

Chaos ventured
deeper into the
labyrinthine halls. As
he progressed, he
began to fall into
a dreamlike state.
Page 23: The winding corridors
seemed to shift as
inexplicable enigmas
danced within his
primitive manbrain.

His rhythmic footsteps
were punctuated by
mysterious sounds;
sudden soft laughter,
or the quiet shutting
of a door.
Page 24: He felt a singular
sense of disquiet as
he strode ever
quicker down the
corridor, fighting the
trancelike waves of
unreality.

He was suddenly
aware of a vast
presence behind him,
and he whirled
around.
Page 25: Shield set and mace
drawn back, but
nothing was there, and
Chaos began to doubt
his own sanity.

§7(Certainly it wasn't
there in the first
place because he kills
a shit load of innocent
people.)
Page 26: Then a notion arose.
Perhaps Chaos was
not really wandering
the halls, not even
moving. Gods! 

He was wandering
within his own mind! He
must get back to
consciousness right
now, lest he wake up
with a sore ass.
Page 27: He struggled through
the blurring mire of
the dreamworld, trying
to reach out for
consciousness.

Finally, with all of his
will, he snapped back
awake, and found
himself in a dim, velvet
room.
Page 28: His armor covered in
rose petals, but
thankfully still on.

Dog goes "woof"
Cat goes "meow"
Bird goes "tweet"
And mouse goes "squeak"
Cow goes "moo"
Frog goes "croak"
And the elephant goes "toot"
Ducks say "quack"

And the seal goes "ow ow ow"

[Pre-Chorus]
But there's one sound
That no one knows
What does the fox say?

Big blue eyes

Chasing mice

Tiny paws
Up the hill
Suddenly you're standing still

So beautiful
Like an angel in disguise
But if you meet
A friendly horse
Will you communicate by

	Title: The Box Part I
	Author: OmgSpaz
	Type: Written

Page 0: This story begins like many others do. A young boy wandering life endlessly wistfully looking for a better future.

Mogand Shay Elmund was his name and he was all but twelve when it happened. Life took a turn that he never expected....
Page 1: A ring at the door came one night as he was sleeping, his father answered the door to find no one there. There was however a box on the step addressed to his son. He considered who it could be from as there was no return adress or marking on the box other
Page 2: than his sons name written on the middle of the box. He set the box on the kitchen table and shortly thereafter went to bed. 

Several hours later Mogand woke, he felt very thirsty so he crawled out of bed. On the way out of his 
Page 3: room he noticed that it was 3:00am. Still tired he he began the arduous journey down the flight of stairs that led to the family room. Adjescent to the stairs was the entry to the kitchen and front door. He felt his way through the dark until he found the
Page 4: kitchen light switch. It took several moments for his eyes to adjust but after fumbling around with the faucet he was finally able to quench his thirst with a tall glass of water. He then began with tedious journey back to his room. But before climbing

Page 5: the stairs a box on the counter caught his attention. It was addressed to him with bold somewhat metalic lettering. The box was not large, but could easily fit the new telescope he had begged his father for just days before.
Page 6: It was no where near christmas nor his birthday so he saw no harm in peeking into the box. 

As he began to strip away the tape the bound the box together he noticed that the box began to heat up slightly. This did not concern him
Page 7: due to the fact that he was too excited to see what the box contained. He was eventually able to open the box but what suprised to see that it was empty... or so he thought.... He then began to wonder why the box was heavy and why it was still warm.
Page 8: Inside and out the box seemed like any other. 
He closed the box and began to walk away when he heard a sound behind him. The box was humming... still not scared he returned to the box and listened closer. He noticed that the humming
Page 9: was actually the faint grinding of gears and cogs. Now quite curious he opened the box again to his suprise that yet again it was empty. Confounded he picked the box up and shook it. He threw it at the wall and it made a strange thud, as if it was made of
Page 10: something much denser than a simple box. Frustrated he fetched the box and began to look closer to the interior. He picked the box up and stuck his head in to get a closer look. The box seemed... bigger on the inside. In fact it was so big on the inside 
Page 11: that as he let the box drop straight down over his head his whole body fit into it. Now he was scared, screaming in fact. The box kept falling, or maybe he was... he could not tell. Falling and falling, expanding on all sides.... he yelled for his father
Page 12: to no avail.

Once he got a good look around he noticed that he was in fact falling towards a dim light in the distance. It seemed like several minutes had passed and yet he was still falling. It became apparent however
Page 13: that there was in fact several lights in this box, many thousands of them. Small and far away they looked like stars in the nights sky. Millions of stars al around him and he was falling straight towards one, falling at greater and greater speeds.
Page 14: Closer now he saw the light was in fact a star. A giant blazing ball of fire in space... and he was falling straight into it.....

The next morning his father came into the kitchen to make breakfast. His father noticed the box that arrived for his son
Page 15: the night before was on the floor and was open. Frustrated he called out for Mogand demanding an answer for why the box had been so carelessly thrown to the ground. As he picked it up he felt suprised as to the boxes weight. He was even more suprised when
Page 16: he turned the box over as the box was seemingly empty...

There was still no answer from his son so he went to Mogand's room and knocked. Still no answer, so he entered. The room was as it always was, messy. But the bed was empty...
Page 17: Concerned now he searched the house, but could not find his boy...

Page 0: life was good back in the days before i met the girl, it was a crisp summer morning and i was taking a stroll over to the nearby lake. i looked across the lake and saw her pale face with her long locks of brown hair, she was the one for me i just knew it!
Page 1: 3 years passed and it went great we built a house by the lake of where we met
but one night i came in the door to find she dident have that perfect smile on her face time seamed to stop... what was wrong? i put down my pork i had just farmed and looked 
Page 2: deep into her blue eyes. she looked back and i saw fear brimming in her eyes.
"whats wrong?" i asked. at that moment a green faced black eyed zombie faced me through the window, he bannged hard on the glass and staired a lifeless stare at mille 2..3..7
Page 3: almost too many zombies to count they had started to bang on the door not long now before it breaks. i readyed my sword. i was swormed by zombies head and foot but they didnot hurt me they simply took what they where here for... mille. they left in a 
Page 4: heart beat, taking my beloved. i searched in town for any lead to her but ownly found the charred remains of a once peacfull town. i saw in the corner of my eye a person, "mille!?" i called but no reply i ran to the house i saw the faint figure stand at, 
Page 5: inside the house i found a bow and some arrows, a faint whisper filled my head. "help me." startled i looked around for mille but she was no where to be seen.
i knew what i had to do, i ran south in search of her.


Page 6: finaly i came to a fallen kingdom and i saw a small zombie clutching a blood stained teddy stare in my direction, it filled me with sorrow to see such an innosent life taken, the words echoed in my head "save my soal." milles voice semed to echo around 
Page 7: the kingdom. i drew back my bow and shot a single arrow into its scull. 
a couple miles south i saw a brown haired girl with torn clothing she had her back to me and i reolised. it was mille! mille i screamed in agony as i noticed her hands where a pale
Page 8: shade of green. she turned and faced me she was holding the porkchop i had layed on the table before the attack. 

"on the otherside of the lake i saw you, what else could i do but say hi to you, but now on the other side of my bow what else could i
Page 9: say but..." a tear rolled down my face as i saw the once pretty body of mille. i breathed deeply and let my bow-string go.

with nothing left i swiftly took my own life.

Page 0: 
What is Laveyan satanism? 
Page 1: Neo (laveyan) satanism is also known as Athiestic satanism, its a selfish non thiestic religion that teaches social darwinism and egoism. Social darwinism is the idea that we apply the concept of natural selection to our society. "Only the strong survive"
Page 2: This idea is rejected by most rational people due to its total abandon of human nature. Our society makes it near impossible for natural selection to occur. 
Lavayan satanism has seven tenants or laws, as well as seven "sins" 
Page 3: Laveyan satanism also condones the practice of "magick". They believe that a man or womans willpower in thought can effect the physical world. They worship more the idea of a literary satan. Unlike thiestic satanism or "luciferianism" 
Page 4: There are multiple sects of modern satanism, the sect i am a member or is known as The Satanic Temple. We reject the ideas of social darwininism,Magick and egoism. We instead take a more humanistic approach. Our sect is based primarily in the united state
Page 5: We use our constitutional right to freedom of religion in order to oppose laws that threaten the seperation of church and state or are otherwise unreasonable. We are, in essence a psuedo religious organization who use legal technicalities to fight
Page 6: religious oppression.  The moral of this short pamphlet is....
Page 7: Satanists are not evil, we are not vile, we do not worship an evil diety and for FUCKS SAKES we do not sacrifice children. As a matter of fact the satanic temple has declared may 15th "Protect children day" Want to know more? visit www.thesatanictemple.

	Author: Artimessheed
	Type: Written

Page 0: -*Guide to the shifting charicters*-

A shifting Charicter is a word/s that are constantly and rapidally changing symbols.
Page 1: -*How to Make*-

To make a shifting charicter, you need:
*Notepad window (Or anything that can translate askey).
*Minecraft.
*Book (Sorry, only in books)
*Knowledge of how to do this. (Supplied later.)
Page 2: -*How to Make*-2
You dont need to know its name, but the symbol that aids in the construction of the shifting charicters.
It is 21 in askey.
How do you make this you ask?
You make it in a askey-friendly typing space, and type...
Page 3: ...Alt + 21 (Note you need to use the part of your keyboard where the digits are in a square, not above the letters.)
Then you put a "k" after the symbol, copy it, paste it into a minecraft book, and wala, you can type shifting charicters...
Page 4: ...(Please note, putting an "r" infront of the symbol, like you did with "k", will cancel the shifting keys effect, this is useful, if you want only a few words blotted out on a page, also note, the shifting keys does not translate to the next page.)

Page 5: Enjoy.

Page 0: §cCh 1: The Dawn.§0
§0
§0In the Dawn of the world, there was no one true king, no one true union of the people, just cities whom waged war on another.§0
§0It was never like this, not one bit, however, the world was much smaller back then...
Page 1: The landfall of the first people on the swamps of the Glavelands, considered the birthplace of all our people. As settlements grew in the Glavelands, travelers set out on various explorations over the land we now know as Alamiji; that is another story.
Page 2: Anyways, the forerunners spread out over the world they now inhabited, establishing cities. Two of those cities were Elbura, and Sar'dann. No empire known to them at that time surpassed either of the cities. The cities' themselves, were not allies in this
Page 3: new world. They were the most bitter of "partners". A non-agression pact began between the two city-states, but the Millitaristic Elburan culture did not coexist with the Arcane philosophy of Sar'dann. Elbura had Karzan riflemen, Sar'dann had The
Page 4: Runelords, whom were both ruilng clan and guild of Sar'dann. As the pressures between the Sar'dic people of the new Glavelands, and the Elburans of the west Delta valley increased, so did their distrust for one another.
Page 5: §cCh 2: The War§0
§0
§0As the tensions grew, The Vannards, a terrorist cell within Elbura, thought the "Elburan people were too tamed by peace, and should follow their lead". Several Vannards attempted to bomb Sar'dans' Citadel, but failed.
Page 6: The following day, the Grandmaster of the Runelords, declared war on Elbura. The war has begun.§0
§0As Elburan troops scrambled to react, the Runelords were on their feet.§0
§0In the start of the war, Elbura attemped to engage in Gurella Warfare, but to no
Page 7: avail, as the Sar'dic Sages dispatched the Elburan footmen, even the Elite Karzan.§0
§0No one knows how he was ever known to begin with, but an Elburan, the fabled Ra'nik Cridea, had been allowed Full control of the Elburan army. His first order of business
Page 8: was to regroup, and establish a new tactic: Lighting Warfare.§0
§0With this, and uncanny Leadership, he had pushed the Sar'dic back to their own territory, where he then established a diplomatic mission to end the war in a peache treaty.
Page 9: There was a memorable Quote during the Meeting when he was asked why he had the "aduacity" To come to their captol. Ra'nik Said: "As Promoted to lead Elbura through the war, I have the responsibility to save as many souls as possible. We all do."

Page 10: It is Finished! The Manor in the sky is finished! It stands above the clouds, and houses a tree, to which I custom-ordered from distant lands. The days of the distant Kingdoms I supported are done, Now I soon will have a kingdom of my own.
Page 11: As the most efficent farm I know of expands, It begs the construction of a Farmhouse, of which I create. And a fishery, and many other things. I have started (But not finished yet) a Pylon, that when done, will be one of the most powerful pylons capible.
Page 12: As the Constructon of the pylon grinds to a halt, due to lack of resources, I set other less-Trifling tasks, or go mining occaisonally. Food of every kind is now readly avaible to me, and as I mine, I find wealth, but not the wealth I seek.
Page 13: The Arcane Nexus Is compleite! Thanks to a trade with IrKewl, The Diamond ore was exchanged for the rest of the Iron needed to finish such a masterful Pylon. It not only gives the finest enchanting, but now surrounds the Island in a barrier aganst Evil.

Page 0: Paragon

Paragons are the elite of the dwarven culture, the pinnacle of dwarven excellence, and the one exception to the rigid caste structure as they can be drawn from any caste, even the casteless.
Page 1: Background

They are noble warriors, politicians, smiths, and even children that all others seek to emulate, and they function as essential role models to all dwarves. While dwarves have no gods, a Paragon
Page 2: is like a god in the eyes of dwarves, which is attributed to the fact that the dwarves venerate their Ancestors, so a living Paragon is considered as a living Ancestor. The word of a Paragon surpasses in weight even the word of a king--even if the 
Page 3: former's title does not grant official power.

Dwarven cities are decorated by monolithic  lifelike statues of Paragons from days past. They are most prominent in the Hall of Heroes inside the surface gates 
Page 4: where the giant statues appear to hold up the ceiling. This is meant to impress--and perhaps intimidate--visitors to Orzammar and to convey upon dwarves heading up to the surface all that they are leaving behind.

Page 5: King Endrin Stonehammer is called as the First Paragon, presumably because his is considered "first among Paragons".
Page 6: Election of Paragons

There are few living Paragons as many dwarves are named Paragon only after their death. The act by which one becomes a Paragon can vary. Typically it is a feat of Bravery in warfare or an
Page 7: incredible invention, but it can also be something as simple as embodying the ideals and tasks of one's caste to an unprecedented perfection. However some have earned the rank for less important pursuits such as writing 
Page 8: particularly good rhymes or brewing stronger ales. A Paragon is elected by the Assembly, which is no easy feat and often involves long debate and even bloodshed. When a Paragon is chosen a house is immediatly created in the name of the
Page 9: Paragon, and their names is recorded in the Memories, the records of the dwarves.

Page 13: Paragon Elect

After the rediscovery of Kal-Sharok, it is revealed that in a time after the kingdom was completely isolated in -15 Ancient and considered lost to the darkspawn horde, the dwarves of that city 
Page 14: changed the way Paragons are worshipped and nominated as well as the type of their power. Paragon Elect is the highest elected government office. Furthermore, the practice of nominating Paragons changed from recognition
Page 15: of past deeds into recognition of promised deeds. In Kal-Sharok Paragons are not rendered as giant statues like Orzammar, but a massive posthumous wall carvings that span lengths of the Deep Roads. The dwarves of Kal-Sharok do
Page 16: not recognize the Paragons of Orzammar and likewise, Orzammar does not recognize their Paragons.
Page 17: Notes

During the Fourth Blight, the siege of Marnas Pell in the Tevinter Imperium took place. The dwarves assisted the Imperium in that battle and then they received many accolades by the ruling Archon. One of these dwarves
Page 18: also became a Paragon.

	Title: Ancestors
	Author: BigSisterMia
	Type: Written

Page 0: Ancestors

The Ancestors are a fundemental element of dwarven culture and life. Not quite a religion, the dwarven system of belief instead reveres the duality of the Stone and the Ancestors. Ancestors are worthy dwarves
Page 1: who have been properly interred in the Stone-- "returned to the Stone" in dwarven parlance-- and who therefore function as guides to their descendants, their noble deeds instructing the dwarves who follow them, and their 
Page 2: voices heard in the justice meted out in the Provings. They are are regarded as honored and deeply respected spirits and all dwarves strive to live lives that honor both their Ancestos and the Stone.

Page 3: The Shaperate, the repository of all dwarven knowledge, history, and genealogy, records the deeds and words of the Ancestors, and thus their memories, in the Memories via lyrium
Page 4: Ancestors and the Stone

In dwarven belief, the Ancestors and the Stone are both inextricably linked but quite seperate. Dwarves of worth who are returned to the Stone upon death become Ancestors after the words of a 
Page 5: ritual are said. The unhonorable and possibly the casteless or surface dwarves are said to be outright rejected by the Stone so that their failings may not weaken her. They are abandoned in desolate caverns for eternity as
Page 6: restless and often malevolent spirits or as rock wraiths. Neither the Stone nor Ancestors are gods to the dwarves, as dwarves have no gods, but Ancestors could not exist without dwarves being interred in the Stone, and the 
Page 7: Stone itself is believed to be the ultimate progenitor of the "Children of the Stone." The Stone is not considered able to intercede in the lives of dwarves in the same way as the Ancestors. The Stone created dwarves, it shelters and 
Page 8: supports dwarves, and the dwarves heed its lessons and dangers, but it is the voices of the Ancestors, and their blessings or lack thereof, which are primarily believed to impact dwarves in their day-to-day life.
Page 9: Ancestors and Paragons

Paragons are dwarves who have achieved a level of success, or completed a task deemed so impossible or glorious, as to be viewed with an unprecedented level of respect,
Page 10: beyond even that of the Ancestors. Unlike Ancestors who become so simply by living worthy lives before their deaths and internment, Paragons must be elected by the Assembly, and a noble house is then formed in their
Page 11: name. Paragons who are nominated while alive are viewed as something akin to a living Ancestor, whose words and actions hold immense weight with the dwarven people. Such "living Ancestors" are very unusual as Paragons are rarely named and 
Page 12: often nominated posthumously, so living Paragons - and consequently living Ancestors- are of immense value.
Page 13: Voice of the Ancestors

The Ancestors are believed to speak to dwarves predominantly through the outcomes of Proving matches, giving or withholding blessings to combatants in
Page 14: matters of honor, judicial, who fought in the Provings to political debates, or the succession of rulers. Dwarves believe without question that a match cannot be won without a blessing of the Ancestors. In spite of this, matches in the Proving
Page 15: Grounds are sometimes rigged in order to assure favorable outcomes despite this being considered an affront to the Ancestors.

I have been spending a lot of time now, and I am becoming bored of what I am doing, so I decided to write a diary to kill time when I am not doing anything, As I was saying, I have been spending a lot of time, alone. I am gettin
Page 2: lonely, yet I can't trust anyone but one of the manipulators and bringers of order in this world. But he can't spend time with me too much because he is too busy bringing order, and following the orders of the creators of this world. So, yeah, I am alone.
Page 3: Very alone. Also, just recently a guy was hounding me and almost killed me, so I decided to get a little payback and arranged a contract with the creator who was hanging with him at the time and he did not particularly care about him, so he let me 
Page 4: teleport to him in order to kill the guy who almost killed me.
The plan was successful, the guy was dead and I walked out of it scot-free.

Page 7: her, right now, I am just hoping she isn't dead yet, because I really love her very much. She is the only amazing and most surprising thing that ever came to my life.

§a§l   CHAPTER ONE§0
§0===================It was a cold day. I warmed my gloves by the fire, hoping that perhaps we'd have an extra set of rations tonight. This was a fool's dream, however, and we all knew it.
Page 2: Despite the brutal conditions and heavy casualties, things were starting to look up. We were quick to relax, as we'd been fighting all through the day. Tjaden suffered a cut to the thigh, seemingly caused by a serrated edge.
Page 3: We cringed at the thought of the wound, as Tjaden slept on one of the only three straw beds we had available for the wounded. The rest of us made camp on the floor. Before drifting to sleep, I began thinking of home.
Page 4: This was a mistake of course, as no soldier should ever dream of home, with its high-rolling green meadows, of its warm breeze against their skin. And especially a soldier should never dream of his parents.
Page 5: It's often good to think of home, but never to create such brittle fantasies, such thin memories, as gentle as a spiderweb. It seemed so foreign to me, it's been 3 years since I slept in my own bed, at home.
Page 6: I often missed my dreary existance in civilian life, but I had grown old in the war, despite my young age. §0
§0
§0It was a glorious day, when we signed up...§0
§0
§0What sweet memories that made...
Page 7: 
§a§l   CHAPTER TWO§0
§0===================I had made haste that morning. I had a usual routine of groggily walking down the stairs around noon, when the sun was high in the sky, still rubbing sleep out of my eyes. Today was different.
Page 8: I awoke at approximately 8:00 sharp, readied myself for the day and set off at 8:30. I can remember it so clearly, yet anything else is fogged, as if someone is heavily breathing on the glass of my mind.
Page 9: I met with my friends from school, readying myself for the careful examination of the combat teacher. Tjaden stood at full attention, as if he was born for no reason other than to battle. Bäumer stood at his best ready position, also, but it was apparent 
Page 10: that he was not yet trained. Pünkte and the other recrutes stood on their best behavior, ready for training. I, however did not want to join the military, and it apparently showed.
Page 11: "Hold fast, recruit! What is your name?"§0
§0"Friedrich" I replied sheepishly. I had not anticipated to be called out in this manner. §0
§0"And what is your last name? The one that matters."§0
§0"Uh... Gärtner, sir!"
Page 12: "And why was your reply late, may I ask? Is this truly your name?" He asked, obviously toying with me.§0
§0"Yes, sir!" I replied, embarrassed. He barked at a few of the recruits in an aggressive tone, but after 3 or 4 of us, he gave up.
Page 13: After hours of physical training and marching-drills, we finally got our rest. It was good, there was plenty of food and beer, and everyone was in a jolly mood, having made it past basic selection.
Page 14: 
§a§l CHAPTER THREE§0
§0===================We awoke early for the next 2 months. The same cycle every day. Wake up before dawn had even broken, run drills for 6 hours, eat, and rest soon afterwards.
Page 15: This continued for nearly half a year, with small breaks in between for Christmas and other holidays. It was not so bad, we were only a village away from my home, so on holidays, I would return to visit my family.
Page 16: Eventually the day came. We were given our field-kits. A cheaply-made iron chestplate which made an amusing *klang!* noise when we jumped, a sturdy set of boots, and a tought set of leather pants.
Page 17: The boots were not so bad, in fact they were quite comfortable to wear around the base camp. The chestplates were clearly made on a whim, by some Bavarian factory-worker looking for a quick buck. They'd stop nothing more than a stick.
Page 18: The leggings were the worst of all. It seemed half of our had come from the frontlines, pulled off of dead soldiers. Bäumer's had a clear cut through the knee-cap, with a suspiciously crimson-red stained left leg. We soon decided that it was clearly not
Page 19: a jelly-stain, as the commander had stated. We had to undergo more training while wearing our field-gear and fencing with wooden swords. Two days after recieving our 'armor', our swords arrived.
Page 20: Tjaden was for once the luckiest of the group. His sword was a finely attuned, Swedish made blade. If you had told us that it was forged yesterday, we all well would have believed it. My blade looked worn and used. It was chipped heavily about the
Page 21: hand-guard and lower blade section. A few men traded blades, though it wouldn't matter much. It was based on opinion. We were told that we would move out in 3 days. Of course, when we heard this, we all left soon afterwards to say goodbye to our friends.
Page 22: 
§a§l  CHAPTER FOUR§0
§0=================== The day had come. We arose at 6:30, the commander was generous enough to give us a half hour's more sleep.
Page 23: I grabbed my pack, and we were rationed loaves of bread and tough sausages of pork. We polished off our sausages and saved the bread for later. Most of us, at least.
Page 24: As we were walking, our breast-plates clanking amidst our marching, our mis-matched swords strewn carefully in the sheathes of those fortunate enough to have one on their battle-worn leggings, it became apparent that we were not well prepared.
Page 25: It seemed as though every day, more and more countries joined in on the meaningless war, and that we were the least prepared of all of them. We were told to set up our camp around an open field, amidst a forest. We managed to do so by about sunset.
Page 26: We finished what little stale bread we had, passing our spare to those who had not been so careful with their rations. As I looked around, passing the heel of my loaf to another soldier, I realized that we may have been ill-prepared, but what we lacked
Page 27: in individual equipment, we made up for in numbers. We were only one regiment of the 20 sent onto the field in the past week, and us alone was 120 men strong. This reasurred me, but it was tough to sleep. We were told of an ambush from the
Page 28: French coming tomorrow. We acted to one another as if there would be no such ambush, but inside, we all knew what would meet us in the morning.
Page 29: 
§a§l  CHAPTER FIVE§0
§0=================== We awoke earlier than usual, likely before 5:00 even. It was dark as the night we struggled to sleep in previously.
Page 30: We all looked around, trying to let our eyes adjust. Pünkte came prepared, however. He pulled a torch and a fire-starting kit from his knapsack. He lit the torch, and it went up like a tiny volcano on the end of a stick. We covered our eyes for a few
Page 31: seconds, as it was very bright. §0
§0"You there!" Hollered the commander§0
§0"Snuff that torch! Do you want them to all know where we are?"§0
§0Cursing under his breath, he quickly extinguished the torch in the mud laid below our tent.
Page 32: We sat in silence for quite some time. We could almost see the sun coming up when we hear the yelling of what sounded like 1,000 men. They trampled the ground, and made us tremble.
Page 33: In the cover of darkness, they ran for us, and it was evident as to why they were so loud. Many of them rode on horses, firing arrows towards us at high velocity.
Page 34: A few of our men charged forward, but it was no use; they were quickly struck down by the better-equipped French cavalry. Many of us stood in place, wide-eyed at what was happening, forgetful to what had been mentioned the night before.
Page 35: "Hold your ground!" Yelled our commander. "Let them move to us!" Hollered a recruit from another section of our regiment, whose voice I recognized not. 
Page 36: The French continued their rush towards us, yelling the whole way, and it felt as though time itself came to a halt. We still stood in awe until a French swordsman got close enough to be beheaded by a sergeant from our regiment.
Page 37: We had heard nothing but stories of courage about the war. Nothing but knights in their shining armor, bucking their horse as its mane fluttered in the wind. This was nonsense. When someone is put in a position we were all facing,
Page 38: all emotion is lost. Everything we had trained and trained for had been forgotten. We fought only for ourselves. From the air it must have looked like someone tried to merge oil and water, clear-cut line drawing its way down the battlefield.
Page 39: It continued for long into the afternoon. Five of us stuck together in a group amidst the chaos of the combat. Bäumer, Tjaden, Pünkte and I stood in a close formation, along with another man whose name we did not know.
Page 40: A few squads came rushing towards us, and Tjaden was the first to strike. His blade dug into a man's midriff, and was stuck in his shoulder. I was watching until I was hit across the face with the hilt of a dagger. Bäumer grabbed the man's arm and forced 
Page 41: him to stab himself with his own dagger. I finally snapped out of my shell-shocked surprise, and realised what was happening. Three more men came towards us. I swung at one, but he was quick. He jumped backwards, but unfortunately for him, his friend was
Page 42: close beside with a lashing strike, which dug into his side. He fell with a yelp, his friend's sword buried in him. I was quick on the draw, and swung from the top downward onto the now weaponless man. He tried to dodge, and I hit him in the shoulder. 
Page 43: His arm came clean off, and blood spurted like water from a pump. It was gruesome, but at the time I was fighting for one reason and one reason only: survival. I swung sideways, decapitating him. His head rolled to the floor, as another lunged at me.
Page 44: I barely managed to raise my sword in time to parry his strike, and it was barely effective, to say the least. He stumbled backwards, into Pünkte, who gladly finished him off with a cut to the throat. This type of horrible warfare continued until late in 
Page 45: the evening. At that point, we had all been scattered across the field, finishing off the last of the French with our heavy broadswords. Their cutlasses were no match in an open environment.
Page 46: I hit a man backwards, and he fell under an injured horse. He was trampled in front of my eyes, and I fought the urge to throw up. I turned and looked at the field, now soaked thoroughly in blood. Our band of friends gathered quickly afterwards, stepping
Page 47: over the disfigured corpses. Bäumer had taken a cut to the left arm, one he would live through with no problem. Tjaden and I remained unscathed, at least physically. Pünkte had not been so fortunate. He lay with his eyes open, unblinking, soaked in a pool
Page 48: of his own blood. Many men lay about us in the same fashion, both French and German, but the sight of a dear friend in such a condition was heart-wrenching. Soon afterwards, the commander requested each squad leader take a head-count and report to him.
Page 49: We would have done so, had our leader not been dead. We tallied our squad. What was once 12 men was now a sorry group of 5. The commander came soon with the total. What was once 120 men was now 70. It was not a good day.§0

	Title: The Name Steve
	Author: jjp1234
	Type: Written

Page 0: Don't ask me what I'm doing here, because I don't know. One day, I woke up in the middle of a forest, covered in snow, devoid of all memory and sense of identity. Why? I have no clue. It almost doesn't matter. I spent the first couple of hours calling for
Page 1: help, wandering around hoping I'd fine someone nearby. After a while, I came to the reluctant conclusion that I was well and truly isolated: no sounds of human voices, no hum of tires on distant roadways; nothing but the trill of far off birds and
Page 2: rustling branches in the wind. There might have been a cow nearby from all the mooing, but I couldn't find it.§0
§0I might not have know who I am, or why I woke up in this snowy forest, but that didn't mean I was going to sit down and let depression take me
Page 3: along with the wolves. I needed a plan of action, need to find a way to survive. But first, a man needs to know himself before he can trust himself, and because my old name was lost to my departed memory. I have decided to call myself Steve. Its a good 
Page 4: name.I spent some time searching the area, looking for anything that might be useful to me. Tools and weapons would be my first priority--don't ask me how I knew, but I could tell the forest would be dangerous at night, I don't know why. There
Page 5: wasn't much, not even a single fallen branch on the ground, just smooth snow and straight pine trees. i tried to grab hold of a few rocks peeking up from the soil,but they were firmly stuck. I'd need something to pry them free, or maybe break them away. I
Page 6: spotted a tree nearby and went to it, running my hands over the dark brown bark. It was a good tree.. strong and healthy.§0
§0
§0So I punched it.§0
§0
§0Pulp and bark flew as my hard fists broke chunk after chunk.
Page 7:  I gritted my teeth against the jarring in my arms and kept going until the whole thing broke through and crashed to the §0ground.Chest§0 heaving from the exertion, I gathered the wood and sat down, examining the pieces. I broke some of the longer chunks into
Page 8: thick sticks, then stabbed on of them into piece of wood shaped like a blade.§0
§0I grinned as I hefted the wooden axe I'd made, then swung it around experimentally. It felt good. I used the axe to fell several more tress until I had enough wood to make all
Page 9: the tools I needed: a shovel, sword and a pickaxe--the latter of which I used to break those stubborn stone from the ground. I stowed the rocks away for later use and strapped the tools to my back. I kept the sword out though, the feeling of danger in the
Page 10: woods tickling the back of my mind. Thus armed, I set off in search of food and shelter.I won't bore you with the details of my struggle against starvation and §0wolves.Suffice§0 it to say, it was a struggle. I fought, bled and conquered. I stumbled over
Page 11: hills and down into water-filled valleys, climbing trees to see the path ahead. I slew cows and ate their flesh to stay alive.I fell off cliffs and broke bones, spending days waiting for them to heal. I briefly marveled at how quickly the wounds mended,
Page 12: but wasted no time in pressing on once they did. At night times, I was attacked by monsters, proving my intuition about the forest to be correct. I hid from the darkness, lighting the small mud huts I'd built along the way with torches until the sim rose
Page 13: once again. I never knew why the world I'd woken up in was filled with skeletons and zombies, but it didn't really matter, I bashed their heads in with stone swords nonetheless. There were more questions to be had than answers, and I knew I would never
Page 14: know half of them.§0
§0
§0I had to SURVIVE!§0
§0
§0Weeks later, exhausted, clothes ripped and torn, blood from numerous cuts on my legs trailing into my socks, I finally found mountains. Majestic. I climbed them each, looking for the ideal spot to build a home
Page 15: far away from the oprressive trees and monster-filled shadows of the forest.I avoided the caves beneath those mountains, fearful of skeletons and massive spiders.I knew I would have to venture inside them eventually, but no then. I finally found a flat
Page 16: topped peak that overlooked the forests to the eats, and the ocean to the west. From its heights, I would be able to see the while land, and defend my homestead from intruders.§0
§0
§0It was good.
Page 17: That was a few months ago. I've since become used to this way of life, in this strange land. The name of Steve fits me like a glove, and I am the master of my modest stone home. I've raised cattle, planted wheat, and baked bread. I've explored those
Page 18: mysterious caved and returned the victor,bringing home coal for fires, iron for tools and armor, precious gold and even a priceless diamond. I am king of all I see, master of this forsaken land And then yesterday, my house blew up.... The building in

Page 4: really really fat) Anyways, yea that was so fun am i right? And if you were wondering, ive been taking care of your castle and your plants although, i hope you haven't completely abandoned it because it has been about 5 years that appointed me this job

Page 3: Prologue
[3 Minutes Before]
 Twas 3 minutes before it all came down. I was sitting on the couch sweat beaten wearing nothing when I heard it coming. It opened the door, and turned out to be Puar. It came with a thrust all over my bust. 
Page 4: [Present]
I saw the Meteor flying down, ready for impact, and knew I had to stop it. I planned slowly and carefully, aligning my mouth perfectly to it. There was sweat on my chin when the red throbbing meteors head landed in my mouth. I knew this would be
Page 5: too much for one person to handle, as it was nearly 4 inches from the ground. The Meteor picked a target of it's taste, a busty tan girl with brown hair, that goes by the name of nrokin. It thrusted back and forth, and I had to act quickly if I wanted to 
Page 6: take down this meteor. I quickly pulled out my tracfone while battling this beast and texted my best friend Vic. You could describe her as very pale, but not as busty, with beautiful hair. She hurried over as fast as she could to help take down this
Page 7: meteor before we could put more people at risk. Victoria and I battled for the head of the meteor, trying our best to take turns, although the meteor kept beating us with it's stick, trying to tell us that it only has a couple of minutes left. That only
Page 8: meant we had to work harder and harder to take it down, and that's when it happened, the meteor exploded into a giant white shower of amazingness all over our faces, and we licked off eachothers faces, spitting it into eachother's mouths. We then finished
Page 9: it off by swallowing. They then spend the next hour or so entertaining themselves in ways TehSabbingSlayer would have enjoyed. They know it won't be the last meteor, so they will always be ready to take down another together, otherwise the whole
Page 10: world is at risk. The tale ends with two bare women feeling accomplishment in their life, very happy with the award they earned. Who knows how many meteors they will have to take on during the weekend...

§0Despite the downpour,
Chaos boldy ventured

The sopping sounds of

Everyone. Not a single

paladin-cow.
Page 3: He didn't stop to think
as he systematically
purged the entire
town.
Penance must be paid

He was on a spiritual
quest to cleanse his
sins he had done in
the company of the
alluring man mage,
Zhalfir.
Page 4: §6Chapter 1

§5-Seven weeks ago, the
hour of the
tendercrisp bacon elf
sandwich.
Page 5: Leaning on the
banister of the
dwarven trade ship,
Chaos saw the Mage's
mighty tower from at
least three fortnight's
walks.

The knight-errant
Chaos had recieved an
ultimatum from the
Dwarven Council.
Page 6: The council were the
rulers of the kingdom
Stoutschmeckle.

Chaos was a simple
man-cow; a mercenary
with a fancy title, and
was by far no means
a hero. He sported a
draping moustache, his
bedraggled hair the
typical burly brown of
his highland homeland.
Page 7: His armor was of
modest leather and
iron, and by chance an
unadorned steel cap
sat atop his head.

No true knight was he.

His equipment
consisted of a sturdy
black mace and a
round shield adorned
with a blue spiral.
Page 8: An ample sack covered
his cape, full of
whimsical odds and
ends necessary for
survival in the world in
which he resided.

The nights were long
and the days were hot,
but in time the sea
voyage met its end.
Page 9: Upon arrival, Chaos
strolled off of the
gangway and onto
solid ground.

The wind whipped up
from the grey ocean
as he beheld the
impressive edifice in
its full glory.
Page 10: Grim clouds slowly
whirled about the top
of the looming
structure, as if by
some...magical force,
perhaps.

He trundled toward
the base of the tower,
and shambled up the
incline to the
entrance.
Page 11: Chaos paused upon
the last step on the
top of the cascading
stairway that led to a
somber, shale door
set in the base of the
stupendous monolith.

A feeling of doubt
washed over him,
quickly being shook
away, knowing he must
press on.
Page 12: He forged his iron will
anew into steel and
reached for the goblin
shaped knocker on the
left of a similar, troll
headed one. 

He recoiled in horror
when the statue's
eyes rolled about
madly.
Page 13: 
"Wahts we got here
Elliott?" the sentient
copper goblin giggled.

"I thinks its fresh
meat for the master."
squealed Elliott the
troll head.
Page 14: Shat-tap, bitch. You
sound like a shrieking
milkmaid who's just
seen a barewolf!
Page 15: "Oh, certainly," replied
the goblin. "But we are
only here to forewarn
the supple fools who
Master lures in.
Secure your ass
plate, noble knight! For
Master desires
manflesh more than
anything these days.

But business is
business, so says I.
Page 16: So enter, but 
remember us well.

For we are the only
pair of knockers you'll
ever see in this tower!
Hee Hee!"

The two copper beings
parted to the sides as
the gates swung
open.
Page 17: Chaos set forth in
determination. He
passed through the
foreboding entrance
and came upon a
crossroads.

Three halls diverged,
marked by troubling,
leering gargoyles. The
left probed deep into
the innermost clutches
of the burly ground.
Page 18: The one ahead
consisted of a
seemingly endless
hallway. The rightmost
path led up a
mesmerizing staircase.

Chaos' keen snout
sensed a moist wind
emanating from the
spiral staircase.
Page 19: Knowing that the
master wizard. Zhalfir
could only exist in a
solid state in sopping
climes, he turned and
began to ascend the
staircase.
Page 20: "Ware the seductions
of Master," the goblin
echoed from behind.
"Even the straightest
arrow can be bent!"

After the warning,
Elliott let loose a
squeal that sounded a
little bit like a fire
hose sprayed through
an electric fan filled
with pelicans and -
Page 21: whistling track
coaches who had a
little too much time on
their hands and liked
to play tug of war
behind the snack
shack but one day the
tennis kids came by
and tipped it over,
subsequently trapping
them in the tomblike
waste wallow and he
hated his life
Page 22: and all the days after
no one looked at him
quite the same way, not
even his family and
that's what Elliott's
scream sounded like.

Chaos ventured
deeper into the
labyrinthine halls. As
he progressed, he
began to fall into
a dreamlike state.
Page 23: The winding corridors
seemed to shift as
inexplicable enigmas
danced within his
primitive manbrain.

His rhythmic footsteps
were punctuated by
mysterious sounds;
sudden soft laughter,
or the quiet shutting
of a door.
Page 24: He felt a singular
sense of disquiet as
he strode ever
quicker down the
corridor, fighting the
trancelike waves of
unreality.

He was suddenly
aware of a vast
presence behind him,
and he whirled
around.
Page 25: Shield set and mace
drawn back, but
nothing was there, and
Chaos began to doubt
his own sanity.

§7(Certainly it wasn't
there in the first
place because he kills
a shit load of innocent
people.)
Page 26: Then a notion arose.
Perhaps Chaos was
not really wandering
the halls, not even
moving. Gods! 

He was wandering
within his own mind! He
must get back to
consciousness right
now, lest he wake up
with a sore ass.
Page 27: He struggled through
the blurring mire of
the dreamworld, trying
to reach out for
consciousness.

Finally, with all of his
will, he snapped back
awake, and found
himself in a dim, velvet
room.
Page 28: His armor covered in
rose petals, but
thankfully still on.

Page 0: 1 Little Duckling
-------------------By Chazzapower
Page 1: On a beautiful morning a young purple dinosaur walked into the survival portal of MuttsWorld, he joined eager to socialize with his friends. He joins with a quiet "Hey guys" and was immediately abused by Tnt378 dropping over 58 times dying from each
Page 2: teleport, Then the little Dino was sad, but still wanted to make ammends with his favourite admin toboein, his offer of kindness and non-spamming was immediately destroyed by this unforgiving admin, though he knew he made this happen from all the spamming
Page 3: he had done requesting the admin to build all his shit for him.
Later the roaring dino, starting to get real tired with everyone's fucking bullshit, decides to talk to his new friend VictoriaAucoin, she ignored the dinosaur.
Then fucked off to 
Page 4: L2D where she punished noobs, including Chazzapower. Then after frustration, the dino goes to his 2nd last "friend" Darkness293,
Darkness called chazza a fucking noob slut then left for creative.
Page 5: After being shut down by all his known friends he goes to his last resort for friendship and fun, TehSabbingSlayer, his best friend.


Oh wait.

"The Little Duckling" was tired of life, and
Page 6: said he would never talk to anyone ever again, then talked later that evening. Then the bullying and abuse came for round 2, and for eternity.
Then one day many years later from continuous abuse, he said "Fuck this" and left forever.

Building


Step 1

>
Page 1: Step 2
Decide
Decide on your plans . Know what materials you need to gather . Estimate how much you might need



>
Page 2: Step 3
Gather
Always gather enough to do an hours worth of building at a time . Bouncing back and forth will slow building time drasticly

>
Page 3: Step 4
Pace Yourself
DOnt burn yourself out on your creation . There is lots to do on Muttsworld . Browse the market for new tools , harvest your professions and sell them off . Socialize . Maybe someone will end up wanting to help
>
Page 4: Step 5
Job Done
Finish off your job by adding details  . Details such as lighting , funiture , floor patterns . Its all adds epicness to your build and makes it pop

>
Page 5: Step 6
Celebrate
Let staff and other players know you just completed your artwork . Invite them to visit . And start planning your next epic build

>
Page 6: Thanks for reading ! 
Keep a lookout for my other books .

Livestock

Step 1
Starting your farm
Build a pen , large enough for your animals , but small enough to keep them organized 
Page 1: Step 2 
Animal Selection
Certain animals give certain things. Cows give leather steak and milk , As do mooshrooms . Pigs only give porkchops , Chickens give eggs , feathers , and raw chicken . Sheep give wool , shearable with shears .      >
Page 2: Step 3
Spawn Eggs
Start your farm with spawn eggs and/or gather farm animals near you. Spawn eggs are the easiest way to start your livestock farm . It will cost you but its easy to make up the cost

>
Page 3: Step 4
Breeding
Chickens  >Seeds
Pigs > Carrots
Cows > Wheat
Sheep > Wheat
Mooshroom > Wheat

it takes 3-5 minecraft days to grow up fully
Page 4: Step 5
Protection
Griefers love to kill animals . Protect them with enclosed pens and land protection . They cant kill what they cant reach
Keep in mind , animals despawn . So harvest or slaughter quickly

>
Page 5: Step 6
Pokeballs
Mutts uses a plugin that allows you to gather animals with less than half health . just throw an egg at them when they are below half . Always save 2 spawn eggs to restart your farms

Page 6: Thanks for reading this book ! Keep a look out for my other books .

Page 0: Lockette and the Wolf, part 1

"How did they meet?"

Chapter 1: I kissed a girl?! This story starts in a Muttsworldbar. Lockette walks in the bar looking for a fun night out and flirting with guys. She is wearing a short skirt 
Page 1: and tights. As Lockette walks by the bar she sees a mysterious person sitting lonely in the corner of the bar. Lockette didn't recognize the person because the mysterious person was wearing a wolf pelt covering part of it' face and body. As it happened to
Page 2: be the person under the wolf pelt is Wolf, hiding for moderators who tried to kill her yesterday for some reason. Lockette was attracted by the mysterious appearance and decided to get her flirt on. As Lockette flirted she didn't seem to recognize it was
Page 3: Wolf nor that she is flirting with a woman.
After an hour of flirting Wolf made her move and said: "How about you and me, in that bathroom?" Lockette was a little shocked and thought to herself: "well Royal can't satisfied me, what the hell we only live 
Page 4: once"thinking she was going to get laid by a boy Lockette agreed. After Wolf gave Lockette a tongue kiss they walked to the woman's bathroom.

chapter 2: Surprise! I do got balls

After they got into the bathroom, Lockette
Page 5: locked the door and starts to kiss Wolf. Not breaking the kiss, Wolf slowly pushes Lockette into the wall. With no way out Lockette gets undressed by wolf. After taking Lockette's shirt and bra off, it was Wolf's time to get some undress by Lockette. As
Page 6: Lockette removed the wolf pelt she was shocked. It wasn't a man naked under the wolf pelt, but a female! Lockette was disappointed and told Wolf she wanted a real man to fuck her not a woman. Disappointed wolf looked away for a second and notice a small 
Page 7: hole in the wall. As she looked through the hole, she could see a part of someones face. She recognized the face, it was Echo the moderator who triend to burn the book that she was writing about DiabloBlade. Wolf spends lots of time writing about 
Page 8: DiabloBlade's amazing penis and gets wet as she thinks about it. But now she didn't have time to think about DiabloBlade's cock as she saw a great chance to get revenge on Echo and proof that she can be above any man. Wolf signed Echo to put his penis 
Page 9: through the hole. As horny as Echo was he put his penis through the hole. Suddenly Wolf got her wooden sword and cut Echo's penis clear off with great ease. It was easy to do with a wooden sword, because Echo' penis wasn't big at all. As Echo was
Page 10: Screaming from the pain, Wolf yells: "How about that for payback? bitch!!!" Wolf picked up the cut off penis and flush it down the toilet as she yells: "Who's the man now?!" Echo ran out of the bar crying. Lockette was so amazed at this experience she 
Page 11: gave the lesbian experience a change.

chapter 3: I fucked a girl and i loved it!

Lockette's still only wearing her skirt and agreed to the lesbian experience. She walked to Wolf and gave her a tongue kiss lasting for at least a minute. Wolf
Page 12: was surprised by Lockette' reaction and told Lockette to lean forward and put her hands òn the wall. Lockette felt exposed and arched het back slightly, tempting Wolf to touch het body. Slowly Wolf removed the tiny skirt covering Lockette's lower parts.
Page 13: All that's between Lockette and Wolf now is the thin little black strip of Lockette's panties. Lockette found herself hoping Wolf would pull them off before she gets them too wet to wear. Wolf hooked her nails into the panties at the hips and pulls them 
Page 14: down. Lockette' legs are parted enough that they only get halfway down her thighs before they pull tight. Lockette arches het back further, pushing her ass out towards Wolf saying: "i want you to touch me, i want your fingers on me, i want your mouth on
Page 15: me. Anything. I just want you touching me. My naked pussy is right in front of you and i can feel you breathing." While she said that Lockette was wondering if Wolf was touching herself. The thought of this made Lockette even hornier. She imagines Wolf
Page 16: standig behind her with her finger rubbing her pussy while she watches all that is exposed in front of her. then Wolf touches Lockette` Her hand feels up between Lockette's legs with a form confidence that made Lockette gasp (sound effect). Suddenly Wolf
Page 17: presses her finger into Lockette and Lockette push back against Wolf's hand. Wolf is ruthless. She pushes her finger straight in as deep and far as her finger could reach and Lockette finds herself gasping and couldn't even cry out (sound effect). Then 
Page 18: Wolf fucked Lockette with her hand.
Two fingers thrust in and out so quickly that Lockette could feel her heels skimming on the floor. Lockette lowered her head and pushed her arms against the wall, curling on her toes just hoping she wouldn't fall. Wolf
Page 19: shoved her hand in harder, fucking Lockette so rough, that her hand slaps on Lockette's ass with each thrust. Lockette's legs are trembling and she can hear her heels tapping irregularly on the floor like drums by drummer on drugs. Lockette leans
Page 20: further forward, her forearms resting vertically on the wall, het elbows banging against the wall. Lockette can't help, but let out a little noise. Lockette thought it would be a moan but it turned out to be more like a growl once it escaped her
Page 21: throat (sound effect). Wolf pushes her thumb between the cheeks of Lockette's ass and rock hard against her like she is trying to lift her off her feet using het pussy as a handhold. Wolf puts the fingers of her other hand right on Lockette's clit. The 
Page 22: fingers in Lockette's pussy suddenly hooked up towards her stomach. Lockette wanted to cum so badly. She wanted it so bad that she can't even form the words to tell Wolf.Lockette's hands are grabbing aimlessly against the wall and her legs are shaking.
Page 23: Lockette thought she might fall. She might just topple down against the toilet.
She continues thinking: "Would you lean down and continue to fuck me if i fell? i can't take the risk, i want to cim so bad". Lockette wanted to take a hand off the wall so 
Page 24: she could grab her breasts and press them hard agaunst her ribs. The orgasm hit Lockette like an atom bomb (sound effect), a deep hot glow that spread and almost consumed her whole body in flame. Lockette felt like a shell of render skin, around a
Page 25: fireball that threatened to consume her. Wolf must of have felt Lockette cumming, because she stopped thrusting and pressed her hand firmly against lockette, holding her steady while she orgasm. Lockette's legs are so shaky that she has to remain leaning 
Page 26: on the wall even after Wolf withdrew her hands. After a few moments of catching her breath and balance she manages to stand up. Lockette can feel her cheeks flushed, throat sweet and she's sure that she is glowing cherry red. Lockette turned to face Wolf
Page 27: and Wolf pressed her wet fingers against Lockette's lips. Lockette kissed them and take them into her mouth. She could taste her own pussy on Wolf' fingers. Lockette's breathing is still unsteady (sound effect), Lockette's lips trembled against Wolf's 
Page 28: hand. Wolf licked her lips and smiled. Lockette wanted to kiss Wolf but she didn't trust herself to mave just yet.
Lockette cleaned herself up a but, before pulling her wet panties up. Lockette goes to the wash basin and splashes a little water on her 
Page 29: face and fixes her hair. Afterwhich Lockette and Wolf got dressed. Before Lockette left through the door, Wolf kissed her and said "next time you may satisfy me" and gave Lockette a card with her number. Wolf left the bathroom and the bar. About 5 minutes
Page 30: Lockette also left the bathroom and the bar.
While Lockette was typing "/home" she thought to herself: "How to pay Wolf back for making me so exposed".

Page 0: DarkEgg
----------
BasicEgg was sitting at his desk thinking to himself. "Fuck. When is school going to end....?". His eyes explored the classroom in hope of finding something amusing to stare at. Just walls.
Page 1: tnt was sitting on the left of BasicEgg, taking notes. And Liimebloop was sitting on his right. Boring as always. He ripped off a piece of paper from his notebook and wrote on it. "Hey Liime, what r u doin after class?" and passed it to his right. 
Page 2: 
Page 3: Liimebloop looked at him skeptically and took it. A few minutes go by before it gets passed back. "Sure, only if tnt will come.". After class they start to discuss what to do. "Hey! Let's go to the girl's part of the school and flirt with them!" tnt said.
Page 4: Basic giggled and nodded his head. Liime just silently followed them. 

Basic goes to an all boy highschool. He's met a few good friends and they just follow him around. 
Page 5: They arrive at the girl's only highschool and search with their eyes for a hot girl. "Hey! Look at her! She has the curves of a model.." Tnt whispered. 
Basic nodded and in one motion pushed Liime out to go talk to her.
Page 6: Hi-hi.. what's your name?
Page 7: They proceed to head back to their school. Their next subject starts in a few minutes. The sit down and start to unpack their books. "Class, we have a new student. Be nice to him." In walks the new kid. Everyone giggles at him because of his bag.
Page 8: One direction. He has a one direction book bag. "Who does he think he is" tnt whispered. But basic didn't care. Their eyes meet and the stare for a few moments. "Hello. Who are you?" basic says politely.
Page 9: "Hello mate." the new kid said in an Australian accent. "My name is Darkness".  "I'm basicegg. Come to my house  after school. Kthxbai" 

After class, basic wrote down his address and gave it to Darkness. 
Page 10: A few hours go by, he still hasn't arrived. Basic sits on his couch and feels hurt. DING DONG. Basic runs to the door and opens it. Darkness walks in. "Please! Sit down!" Basic screams. "From the moment I saw you, my heart pounded hard. 
Page 11: I want to fuck you."
Page 12: Darkness stands up confusses and jokingly says "Only if I'm the giver!" and basic nods. Basic sits down and darkness rushes to pull off his pants. He starts giving basic head. And basic sits back and enjoys it. Running his fingers through darknesses hair.
Page 13: Basic pulls his headoff and has darkness lie down. He gets on top of him and starts sucking his cock while darkness sucks his. Muffled moans come from the two of them as they enjoy themselves. Time flies as they pleasure each other.
Page 14: Darkness eventually stops and basic gets on all fours. His cock soaking wet from all the sucking, slides right into basic's ass. He fucks him hard for a while before cumming into him. He pulls out and they both breathe hard. "That was okay" basic said.
Page 15: "Okay? OKAY? I loved it!" Darkness proclaimed. They dressed and darkness kissed him goodbye. 
The end.

Page 0: John woke up, he always woke up before any sound was there to wake him, but no-one would ever actually know that, he waiting on his bed with his eyes closed, going back over his thoughts from the night before, feeling the torrent begin again,
Page 1: the masses of information swirled around his head, it was like loud rock music being blasted directly into his brain and it almost always ended with him getting a headache. After what felt like a few minutes had passed, he heard the sound of his mother
Page 2: calling him from downstairs, there was some logic missing in this, he had long ago decided, as he always, without fail, got up fifteen minutes before he was meant to be at school, which was the exact amount of time it took for him to throw on his uniform,
Page 3: eat breakfast, and take the short journey to school. John's mother however, had never seemed to grasp this fact, and insisted on calling him down approximately forty-five minutes before he had to be there, despite him remaining in his state
Page 4: of psudo-sleep for another half and hour, he did not fail to meet this tradition on that particular morning. After the usual argument about this morning ritual had taken place, and no ground had been made by either individual, he lifelessly chewed on his 
Page 5: toast and made his way to school, he arrived slinging his bag onto the floor and waiting for the morning period to start, some people he considered his friends chatted amiably in the background about nothing in particular and he continued to sit there,
Page 6: not paying any heed, the teacher arrived and he stood up, his teachers name was Dr Smith and she was one of the few teachers in the school who seemed to have an ounce of logic, and therefore he respected her greatly, logic being something that was in 
Page 7: short supply in the world in general, still feeling that same sense of disconnecteddness he shuffled into the room and took his seat, he took out a pad of paper and absently began to write, not paying any particular attention to what he wrote, he looked
Page 8: down and proclaimed it to be garbage and scrunched it up and shoved it in a pocket for either some further use later or to be thrown away, he played with his pen, only pausing in his thoughts to respond to his name being called, he was struck by a sudden 
Page 9: and totally irrational sadness, his mind helpfully threw up some images of the worst events he could think about and his hands started to shake, he stilled them with a concious mental effort and began trying to focus on what the teacher was saying, the
Page 10: words slipping out of his mind, he suffered from working and short term memory issues, that was what the report said anyway, his attention rapidly diminished and he went back to his pen, which he looked at sadly and put away, his friend said something
Page 11: to him which he responded to without thinking, he was suddenly and without any kind of warning very irritated by this and wanted to be alone. It was horrible, the way he viewed the world constantly shifting and changing, with no reason or method.
Page 12: He wanted to scream and run out of the classroom, and finally break down and let his emotions run, but he never would, he had to keep up the appearence of sanity, or what was left of it, people did notice his strangeness, he was an oddity and could never
Page 13: seem to say the right thing, he glared enviously at the people to whom the right things to say seemed to come so easily, he attempted to smile and only managed to make his face scrunch into something horrible, people gave him odd looks and he tried to
Page 14: cover it with a signature manic smile, he would rather let it be known that he was odd that let people know he just couldn't do it, his face wouldn't do what he wanted it to, and it always ended up looking stupid, inappropriate, or both.


Page 15: The bell rang, waking John from his idle musings, he grabbed his bag and made his way to the biology classroom. The rest of the day was filled with idle conversation with the few people who wanted to talk to him, or at least were willing to, and the
Page 16: scratching of his pen on paper, writing words, but never the ones that he wanted to write, words without meaning.

The clock lazily swung its hands towards the ending of the day, and he swung his backpack onto his back. When he got home he went on
Page 17: his computer, looking at several things that did make him laugh internally, he was not humourless, as some people thought, it was just that he was never really able to express his joy, or at least that was what he told himself. His mother greeted him when
Page 18: he got home and he dutifully filled out the expected role and said his day was fine with a forced smile, people irritated him, it wasn't their fault, they just did what they were expected to do, they filled their roles, because they had never been taught 
Page 19: that they were allowed to become more than what was expected, to think outside the box and actually act on those obscure concepts such as 'making the world a better place'. John could never do that, not since he had realised that he didn't have to, but it
Page 20: still got to him, not that people rejected him for it, it would take more than that to break his will, but more the shrugs of indifference that they expressed, like they had seen it before, he was just another kid who thought rebellion was as simple as
Page 21: declaring yourself different and wearing black, but he never intended to do that, he wanted to go out and face the darkness of the world, force it to confront him, but the world would not listen.

Besides, he knew it wasn't that simple, people could not
Page 22: just go out and face the dark like batman and superman, that would not change anything, he might, if he became a policeman stop a hundred or a thousand crimes, but that would not change anything, what was needed was something that would change the world,
Page 23: permanently for the better, to finally make people realised that it was something different to declare that people should respect others regardless of who they were, and to actually act upon it, the difference between carrying out the role of someone
Page 24: who wanted things to change, and the person who actually sits there and tries to work out how to make the world a better place for everyone, once and for all...

-------------------By Chazzapower
Page 1: On a beautiful morning a young purple dinosaur walked into the survival portal of MuttsWorld, he joined eager to socialize with his friends. He joins with a quiet "Hey guys" and was immediately abused by Tnt378 dropping over 58 times dying from each
Page 2: teleport, Then the little Dino was sad, but still wanted to make ammends with his favourite admin toboein, his offer of kindness and non-spamming was immediately destroyed by this unforgiving admin, though he knew he made this happen from all the spamming
Page 3: he had done requesting the admin to build all his shit for him.
Later the roaring dino, starting to get real tired with everyone's fucking bullshit, decides to talk to his new friend VictoriaAucoin, she ignored the dinosaur.
Then fucked off to 
Page 4: L2D where she punished noobs, including Chazzapower. Then after frustration, the dino goes to his 2nd last "friend" Darkness293,
Darkness called chazza a fucking noob slut then left for creative.
Page 5: After being shut down by all his known friends he goes to his last resort for friendship and fun, TehSabbingSlayer, his best friend.


Oh wait.

"The Little Duckling" was tired of life, and
Page 6: said he would never talk to anyone ever again, then talked later that evening. Then the bullying and abuse came for round 2, and for eternity.
Then one day many years later from continuous abuse, he said "Fuck this" and left forever.

Page 0: §9Prologue:

§0Despite the downpour,
Chaos boldy ventured
on into the woeful
valley of
blackened elms.

The sopping sounds of
his splashing feet
echoed into the still,
rain-drenched woods.
Page 1: The burdens he bore
were great, not only
those on his
back, but those of the
heavy toll of sin on
his soul.

Everyone. Not a single
peasant spared. He
mused over his
decision to kill
everyone that looked
like the damned.
Page 2: "Perhaps my judgement
was too harsh. Yes,
that woman really
meant no harm."

He chuckled in
remembrance of the
mass slaughter in the
peaceful hamlet.
Chaos was a hearty
paladon-cow.
Page 3: He didn't stop to think
as he systematically
purged the entire
town.
Penance must be paid

He was on a spiritual
quest to cleanse his
sins he had done in
the company of the
alluring man mage,
Zhalfir.
Page 4: §6Chapter 1

§5-Seven weeks ago, the
hour of the
tendercrisp bacon elf
sandwich.

Page 5: Leaning on the
banister of the
dwarven trade ship,
Chaos saw the Mage's
mighty tower from at
least three fortnight's
walks.

The knight-errant
Chaos had recieved an
ultimatum from the
Dwarven Council.
Page 6: The council were the
rulers of the kingdom
Stoutschmeckle.

Chaos was a simple
man-cow; a mercenary
with a fancy title, and
was by far no means
a hero. He sported a
draping moustache, his
bedraggled hair the
typical burly brown of
his highland homeland.
Page 7: His armor was of
modest leather and
iron, and by chance an
unadorned steel cap
sat atop his head.

No true knight was he.

His equipment
consisted of a sturdy
black mace and a
round shield adorned
with a blue spiral.
Page 8: An ample sack covered
his cape, full of
whimsical odds and
ends necessary for
survival in the world in
which he resided.

The nights were long
and the days were hot,
but in time the sea
voyage met its end.
Page 9: Upon arrival, Chaos
strolled off of the
gangway and onto
solid ground.

The wind whipped up
from the grey ocean
as he beheld the
impressive edifice in
its full glory.
Page 10: Grim clouds slowly
whirled about the top
of the looming
structure, as if by
some...magical force,
perhaps.

He trundled toward
the base of the tower,
and shambled up the
incline to the
entrance.
Page 11: Chaos paused upon
the last step on the
top of the cascading
stairway that led to a
somber, shale door
set in the base of the
stupendous monolith.

A feeling of doubt
washed over him,
quickly being shook
away, knowing he must
press on.
Page 12: He forged his iron will
anew into steel and
reached for the goblin
shaped knocker on the
left of a similar, troll
headed one. 

He recoiled in horror
when the statue's
eyes rolled about
madly.
Page 13: "Wahts we got here
Elliott?" the sentient
copper goblin giggled.

"I thinks its fresh
meat for the master."
squealed Elliott the
troll head.
Page 14: 
"Shat-tap, bitch. You
sound like a shrieking
milkmaid who's just
seen a barewolf!"
retorted the goblin.
"What say you, you
magical trickeries and
metallic neon-eyed
fiends?" probed
Chaos.
"Am I not entitled to
enter the tower?"
Page 15: "Oh, certainly," replied
the goblin. "But we are
only here to forewarn
the supple fools who
Master lures in.
Secure your ass
plate, noble knight! For
Master desires
manflesh more than
anything these days.

But business is
business, so says I.
Page 16: So enter, but 
remember us well.

For we are the only
pair of knockers you'll
ever see in this tower!
Hee Hee!"

The two copper beings
parted to the sides as
the gates swung
open.

Page 17: Chaos set forth in
determination. He
passed through the
foreboding entrance
and came upon a
crossroads.

Three halls diverged,
marked by troubling,
leering gargoyles. The
left probed deep into
the innermost clutches
of the burly ground. 
Page 18: The one ahead
consisted of a
seemingly endless
hallway. The rightmost
path led up a
mesmerizing staircase.

Chaos' keen snout
sensed a moist wind
emanating from the
spiral staircase.
Page 19: 
Knowing that the
master wizard. Zhalfir
could only exist in a
solid state in sopping
climes, he turned and
began to ascend the
staircase.
Page 20: "Ware the seductions
of Master," the goblin
echoed from behind.
"Even the straightest
arrow can be bent!"

After the warning,
Elliott let loose a
squeal that sounded a
little bit like a fire
hose sprayed through
an electric fan filled
with pelicans and -
Page 21: whistling track
coaches who had a
little too much time on
their hands and liked
to play tug of war
behind the snack
shack but one day the
tennis kids came by
and tipped it over,
subsequently trapping
them in the tomblike
waste wallow and he
hated his life
Page 22: and all the days after
no one looked at him
quite the same way, not
even his family and
that's what Elliott's
scream sounded like.

Chaos ventured
deeper into the
labyrinthine halls. As
he progressed, he
began to fall into
a dreamlike state.
Page 23: The winding corridors
seemed to shift as
inexplicable enigmas
danced within his
primitive manbrain.

His rhythmic footsteps
were punctuated by
mysterious sounds;
sudden soft laughter,
or the quiet shutting
of a door.
Page 24: He felt a singular
sense of disquiet as
he strode ever
quicker down the
corridor, fighting the
trancelike waves of
unreality.

He was suddenly
aware of a vast
presence behind him,
and he whirled
around.
Page 25: Shield set and mace
drawn back, but
nothing was there, and
Chaos began to doubt
his own sanity.

§7(Certainly it wasn't
there in the first
place because he kills
a shit load of innocent
people.)
Page 26: Then a notion arose.
Perhaps Chaos was
not really wandering
the halls, not even
moving. Gods! 

He was wandering
within his own mind! He
must get back to
consciousness right
now, lest he wake up
with a sore ass.
Page 27: He struggled through
the blurring mire of
the dreamworld, trying
to reach out for
consciousness.

Finally, with all of his
will, he snapped back
awake, and found
himself in a dim, velvet
room.
Page 28: His armor covered in
rose petals, but
thankfully still on.

Page 6: other people who moved on, i never stopped missing them, or loving them, orprotecting them. IF SOMEONE LAYS A HAND ON THEM I WILL SLAP THEM, anyways... I hope you have a great life,,.. just remeber i love all the people who moved on. APPARENTLY EVAN 
Page 7: HASNT WHICH I WISH HE WOULD. I WOULDNT PROTECT HIM. As a little kid i used to walk up to other kids and we automatically become friends, but ive changed, i've also chaged since uve know me, ive become, more protective... Just beware... LOL. I'm just 
Page 8: saying that i will miss you and i still want to be friends and have sleepovers, but prob not as many sleepovers, I STILL WANT ME SUNNY D... sorry. Like i said. I protective. If you hadent ask me to facetime me then i prob. would be all alone becase
Page 9: like i said one loss becaomes another bff, and if i hadent met you then maybe i would still be a cry baby or something like that. Uve toughed me up a little. Im glad we met eachothr. Even though we rnt bffs anymore ill protect u. No matter what.
Page 10: Oh, and sometimes in class when lexi is talking to other people, she ignores me... I am pretty much friends with everyone in my class...excpet 4 evan and pablo cause they suck.. but... anyways... I will never hurt u or let anyone hurt u

	Type: Written

Page 0:    Wilkommen nach§0
§a§l LERNEN DEUTSCH§0
§0=================== §0
§0An incredibly basic book for learning simple German phrases. §0
§0
§0   Written by§6 Neskah§0.§0
§0
§0
§0
§3?§0: Ekip Publishings
Page 1: 
§0   §3§lINTRODUCTION§0
§0===================Welcome, reader! In this book, we will be discussing very basic German conversational skills. Please note: This book will §cNOT §0Fully teach you German.
Page 2: §3§l    NON-ENGLISH§0
§3§l      LETTERS§0
§0=================== If you're going to learn German, even basic phrases, there are 4 special characters you have to be aware of. 3 of them are what we call Umlaute. Umlaute are either an A, O, or U with 2 dots.
Page 3: §3ä§0: This character sounds very close to pronouncing the English letter A in the alphabet. (§aAYY§0), although it has less of a twang to it. Instead of pronouncing with a Y sound on the end, try saying "eh?"
Page 4: §3ü§0: With the U umlaut, things get more difficult. Try making an E sound, as in the word §6Me§0. While making this continued EE sound, curve your lips dramatically, like you're kissing someone or making an U sound. 
Page 5: §3ö§0: Like the U umlaut, combine the U sound with an English A. As in the word §6bay§0. While making this A sound, curve your lips, the sound produced should be a U umlaut.§0
§cPlease use Google for this part, it's very difficult to describe on-paper.
Page 6: §3ß§0: This is an Eszet. Make sure not to mistake it for a B, as it's pronounced nothing like it. The eszet is basically a short way to write a double s in German.§0
§0Example:§0
§6Füßen§0, a short way to write §6Füssen§0. §0
§0(§6Feet§0, in English.)
Page 7: A few other things to note about pronounciation of German letters:§0
§0===================§6W§0: Pronounced exactly like an English V.§0
§6V§0: Pronounced exactly like an English F.§0
§6J§0: Pronounced like an English Y. Example:§0
§0Ja = Yah.
Page 8: §6R§0: Google this one, too. It's pronounced very much like a French R, a gutteral sound from the back of your throat.§0
§6Z§0: Pronounced like an English TS. As in Pan§6ts§0. For example, Zehn (ten) is pronounced like Tsayn.
Page 9: Just like in English, groups of letters will make certain sounds together.§0
§6sch§0: Pronounced exactly like an English SH. Example: Tschüss!§0
§0would be pronounced like tshooss. (It's similar to saying Cheers! to a friend.)
Page 10: §6eu§0: Pronounced like an English -oy, as in the word b§6oy§0.§0
§6äu§0: Exactly like the EU, it is pronounced like -oy.§0
§6ie§0: Pronounced like an English ee, as in B§6ee§0.§0
§6ei§0: Pronounced like the English letter I, as in NEIN!
Page 11: §6-ch§0: The infamous flem, like you're coughing up a hairball. I'd recommend Googling this one, too.§0
§6-r§0: When an R comes at the end of a word, like a British accent, it is not pronounced. Example: Besser is pronounced like Bessah.
Page 12: §cth§0: This one is in red because it is NOT pronounced in German like in English. There is not a TH sound (like in the) in German. A TH together is simply pronounced like a T.
Page 13: Keep in mind that silent letters are almost nonexistant in German! Often you will find E's on the end of words, these are pronounced like (uh), like you're thinking about something. (uhhhh)§0
§0Example: Bitte is pronounced bit-tuh
Page 14: Now, on to what you came here for! Phrase-learning!§0
§0
§0These are very simple phrases, that if practiced enough, could come in handy when travelling.

	Title: The Name Steve
	Author: jjp1234
	Type: Written

Page 0: Don't ask me what I'm doing here, because I don't know. One day, I woke up in the middle of a forest, covered in snow, devoid of all memory and sense of identity. Why? I have no clue. It almost doesn't matter. I spent the first couple of hours calling for
Page 1: help, wandering around hoping I'd fine someone nearby. After a while, I came to the reluctant conclusion that I was well and truly isolated: no sounds of human voices, no hum of tires on distant roadways; nothing but the trill of far off birds and
Page 2: rustling branches in the wind. There might have been a cow nearby from all the mooing, but I couldn't find it.§0
§0I might not have know who I am, or why I woke up in this snowy forest, but that didn't mean I was going to sit down and let depression take me
Page 3: along with the wolves. I needed a plan of action, need to find a way to survive. But first, a man needs to know himself before he can trust himself, and because my old name was lost to my departed memory. I have decided to call myself Steve. Its a good 
Page 4: name.I spent some time searching the area, looking for anything that might be useful to me. Tools and weapons would be my first priority--don't ask me how I knew, but I could tell the forest would be dangerous at night, I don't know why. There
Page 5: wasn't much, not even a single fallen branch on the ground, just smooth snow and straight pine trees. i tried to grab hold of a few rocks peeking up from the soil,but they were firmly stuck. I'd need something to pry them free, or maybe break them away. I
Page 6: spotted a tree nearby and went to it, running my hands over the dark brown bark. It was a good tree.. strong and healthy.§0
§0
§0So I punched it.§0
§0
§0Pulp and bark flew as my hard fists broke chunk after chunk.
Page 7:  I gritted my teeth against the jarring in my arms and kept going until the whole thing broke through and crashed to the §0ground.Chest§0 heaving from the exertion, I gathered the wood and sat down, examining the pieces. I broke some of the longer chunks into
Page 8: thick sticks, then stabbed on of them into piece of wood shaped like a blade.§0
§0I grinned as I hefted the wooden axe I'd made, then swung it around experimentally. It felt good. I used the axe to fell several more tress until I had enough wood to make all
Page 9: the tools I needed: a shovel, sword and a pickaxe--the latter of which I used to break those stubborn stone from the ground. I stowed the rocks away for later use and strapped the tools to my back. I kept the sword out though, the feeling of danger in the
Page 10: woods tickling the back of my mind. Thus armed, I set off in search of food and shelter.I won't bore you with the details of my struggle against starvation and §0wolves.Suffice§0 it to say, it was a struggle. I fought, bled and conquered. I stumbled over
Page 11: hills and down into water-filled valleys, climbing trees to see the path ahead. I slew cows and ate their flesh to stay alive.I fell off cliffs and broke bones, spending days waiting for them to heal. I briefly marveled at how quickly the wounds mended,
Page 12: but wasted no time in pressing on once they did. At night times, I was attacked by monsters, proving my intuition about the forest to be correct. I hid from the darkness, lighting the small mud huts I'd built along the way with torches until the sim rose
Page 13: once again. I never knew why the world I'd woken up in was filled with skeletons and zombies, but it didn't really matter, I bashed their heads in with stone swords nonetheless. There were more questions to be had than answers, and I knew I would never
Page 14: know half of them.§0
§0
§0I had to SURVIVE!§0
§0
§0Weeks later, exhausted, clothes ripped and torn, blood from numerous cuts on my legs trailing into my socks, I finally found mountains. Majestic. I climbed them each, looking for the ideal spot to build a home
Page 15: far away from the oprressive trees and monster-filled shadows of the forest.I avoided the caves beneath those mountains, fearful of skeletons and massive spiders.I knew I would have to venture inside them eventually, but no then. I finally found a flat
Page 16: topped peak that overlooked the forests to the eats, and the ocean to the west. From its heights, I would be able to see the while land, and defend my homestead from intruders.§0
§0
§0It was good.
Page 17: That was a few months ago. I've since become used to this way of life, in this strange land. The name of Steve fits me like a glove, and I am the master of my modest stone home. I've raised cattle, planted wheat, and baked bread. I've explored those
Page 18: mysterious caved and returned the victor,bringing home coal for fires, iron for tools and armor, precious gold and even a priceless diamond. I am king of all I see, master of this forsaken land And then yesterday, my house blew up.... The building in 
Page 19: peices, the monsters who blew this place to shambles. I gave them a name. I call them§0
§0

Page 4:      Introduction§0
§0=================== Welcome to potion brewing! If you're new, keep in mind that you need a brewing stand, glass bottles filled with water, and many ingredients, which vary depending on what type of potion you may want to create.
Page 5:      Introduction§0
§0=================== Every brewing stand has the capability to hold at maximum three bottles at a time, meaning you can make 3 potions for every single ingredient you add. Keep this in mind!
Page 6:   Base Ingredients§0
§0=================== These ingredients start all potions.§0
§0------------------- ?Nether Wart§0
§0?Glowstone Dust§0
§0?Redstone§0
§0?Fermented Spider Eye [Adding these to a water bottle will create a base potion. see page 11]

§0?Fermented Spider Eye§0
§0[See next page]
Page 9:   Effect Corruption§0
§0=================== Fermented Spider Eyes will change a potion's base effect, often reversing it or producing a negative potion. A "corrupted" potion usually does the opposite of the original potion.
Page 10:       Base Potions§0
§0=================== Base potions, much like base ingredients, are the basis of all potions. These are the potions created by simply a watter bottle and a base ingredient together.

§0===================Effect Potions are any potion that can be used to add any sort of effect onto a player. There are both positive and negative effect potions, both of which can give advantages in combat, or even in building or mining.

§0    This week in the muttsworld community§0
§0we had reports of chickens randomly spawning on players. This occurance has caused question in how the world of minecraft really works.
Page 2:      In further news, Ekip publishing has dominated the market with two popular novels -- "The Name Steve" & "Black Marsh". They have recently announced the publishing of more novels and learning books.
Page 3:     We have had reports of mass vote spam. I guess this is the hype for the server. I would suggest to go vote and support its cause.§0
§0
§0   Meanwhile the community economy is at an all time high as prices are decreasing.

§a§l LERNEN DEUTSCH§0
§0=================== §0
§0An incredibly basic book for learning simple German phrases. §0
§0
§0   Written by§6 Neskah§0.§0
§0
§0
§0
§3?§0: Ekip Publishings
Page 1: 
§0   §3§lINTRODUCTION§0
§0===================Welcome, reader! In this book, we will be discussing very basic German conversational skills. Please note: This book will §cNOT §0Fully teach you German.
Page 2: §3§l    NON-ENGLISH§0
§3§l      LETTERS§0
§0=================== If you're going to learn German, even basic phrases, there are 4 special characters you have to be aware of. 3 of them are what we call Umlaute. Umlaute are either an A, O, or U with 2 dots.
Page 3: §3ä§0: This character sounds very close to pronouncing the English letter A in the alphabet. (§aAYY§0), although it has less of a twang to it. Instead of pronouncing with a Y sound on the end, try saying "eh?"
Page 4: §3ü§0: With the U umlaut, things get more difficult. Try making an E sound, as in the word §6Me§0. While making this continued EE sound, curve your lips dramatically, like you're kissing someone or making an U sound. 
Page 5: §3ö§0: Like the U umlaut, combine the U sound with an English A. As in the word §6bay§0. While making this A sound, curve your lips, the sound produced should be a U umlaut.§0
§cPlease use Google for this part, it's very difficult to describe on-paper.
Page 6: §3ß§0: This is an Eszet. Make sure not to mistake it for a B, as it's pronounced nothing like it. The eszet is basically a short way to write a double s in German.§0
§0Example:§0
§6Füßen§0, a short way to write §6Füssen§0. §0
§0(§6Feet§0, in English.)
Page 7: A few other things to note about pronounciation of German letters:§0
§0===================§6W§0: Pronounced exactly like an English V.§0
§6V§0: Pronounced exactly like an English F.§0
§6J§0: Pronounced like an English Y. Example:§0
§0Ja = Yah.
Page 8: §6R§0: Google this one, too. It's pronounced very much like a French R, a gutteral sound from the back of your throat.§0
§6Z§0: Pronounced like an English TS. As in Pan§6ts§0. For example, Zehn (ten) is pronounced like Tsayn.
Page 9: Just like in English, groups of letters will make certain sounds together.§0
§6sch§0: Pronounced exactly like an English SH. Example: Tschüss!§0
§0would be pronounced like tshooss. (It's similar to saying Cheers! to a friend.)
Page 10: §6eu§0: Pronounced like an English -oy, as in the word b§6oy§0.§0
§6äu§0: Exactly like the EU, it is pronounced like -oy.§0
§6ie§0: Pronounced like an English ee, as in B§6ee§0.§0
§6ei§0: Pronounced like the English letter I, as in NEIN!
Page 11: §6-ch§0: The infamous flem, like you're coughing up a hairball. I'd recommend Googling this one, too.§0
§6-r§0: When an R comes at the end of a word, like a British accent, it is not pronounced. Example: Besser is pronounced like Bessah.
Page 12: §cth§0: This one is in red because it is NOT pronounced in German like in English. There is not a TH sound (like in the) in German. A TH together is simply pronounced like a T.
Page 13: Keep in mind that silent letters are almost nonexistant in German! Often you will find E's on the end of words, these are pronounced like (uh), like you're thinking about something. (uhhhh)§0
§0Example: Bitte is pronounced bit-tuh
Page 14: Now, on to what you came here for! Phrase-learning!§0

§0These are very simple phrases, that if practiced enough, could come in handy when travelling.

Page 1: On a beautiful morning a young purple dinosaur walked into the survival portal of MuttsWorld, he joined eager to socialize with his friends. He joins with a quiet "Hey guys" and was immediately abused by Tnt378 dropping over 58 times dying from each
Page 2: teleport, Then the little Dino was sad, but still wanted to make ammends with his favourite admin toboein, his offer of kindness and non-spamming was immediately destroyed by this unforgiving admin, though he knew he made this happen from all the spamming
Page 3: he had done requesting the admin to build all his shit for him.
Later the roaring dino, starting to get real tired with everyone's fucking bullshit, decides to talk to his new friend VictoriaAucoin, she ignored the dinosaur.
Then fucked off to 
Page 4: L2D where she punished noobs, including Chazzapower. Then after frustration, the dino goes to his 2nd last "friend" Darkness293,
Darkness called chazza a fucking noob slut then left for creative.
Page 5: After being shut down by all his known friends he goes to his last resort for friendship and fun, TehSabbingSlayer, his best friend.


Oh wait.

"The Little Duckling" was tired of life, and
Page 6: said he would never talk to anyone ever again, then talked later that evening. Then the bullying and abuse came for round 2, and for eternity.
Then one day many years later from continuous abuse, he said "Fuck this" and left forever.

Commands:

/fl name - this forces someone into local. 

/denoob - you know what this does


Page 1: /mp name channel
and
/ump name channel
mutes and unmutes a player in specified channel.

/newestregion: takes you to the newest /village for new players.
Page 2: Guidelines on mutes:

1. Do not mute someone for personal reasons, a few caps, or as a joke. Do not mute them if they sent 2 duplicate lines, like during lag spikes. Do not mute them unless they are an obvious disruption to chat.
Page 3: 2. Don't argue with people in global channels. Keep it in /tell or local.

3. Always be in noob chat. You will hear a ding noise everytime a new player joins. Say hi, welcome them. Be nice. Pay attention to noob chat.
Page 4: 4. You represent the server so act like it. Don't be a jerk like the admins. Be nice.

5. Learn how to be trolled and get used to them trying to make you mad on purpose. Some players love to pick on the younger staff memebers.
Page 5: 6. Unmuting:

NEVER unmute anyone from noob chat. ever.

If the player can tell you why they were muted and apologize for it, then you may unmute them. If they don't know, talk to them until they figure it out.
Page 6: Most important rule:

Staff chat is not filtered. It is mostly 18+ and can be out of hand sometimes. If you feel uncomfortable in staff chat at any time just /leave st. What goes on in staff chat is kept in staff chat. You are not to repeat things said in
Page 7: staff chat! Its very easy for us to find 'leaks' so please keep in mind, staff chat exists for a reason.

Dog goes "woof"
Cat goes "meow"
Bird goes "tweet"
And mouse goes "squeak"
Cow goes "moo"
Frog goes "croak"
And the elephant goes "toot"
Ducks say "quack"

And the seal goes "ow ow ow"

[Pre-Chorus]
But there's one sound
That no one knows
What does the fox say?

Big blue eyes

Chasing mice

Tiny paws
Up the hill
Suddenly you're standing still

So beautiful
Like an angel in disguise
But if you meet
A friendly horse
Will you communicate by

The secret of the fox
Ancient mystery
Somewhere deep in the woods
I know you're hiding
What is your sound?
Will we ever know?
Will always be a mystery
What do you say?

You're my guardian angel
Hiding in the woods
What is your sound?

I brought you for as a gift for Justin, so that they could practice to look after a horse, but it seems like they weren't ready......

Olando, the younger brother of your master, could hold the responsibility so killed you so he wouldn't have a horse to look after.

	Title: The Box Part I
	Author: OmgSpaz
	Type: Written

Page 0: This story begins like many others do. A young boy wandering life endlessly wistfully looking for a better future.

Mogand Shay Elmund was his name and he was all but twelve when it happened. Life took a turn that he never expected....
Page 1: A ring at the door came one night as he was sleeping, his father answered the door to find no one there. There was however a box on the step addressed to his son. He considered who it could be from as there was no return adress or marking on the box other
Page 2: than his sons name written on the middle of the box. He set the box on the kitchen table and shortly thereafter went to bed. 

Several hours later Mogand woke, he felt very thirsty so he crawled out of bed. On the way out of his 
Page 3: room he noticed that it was 3:00am. Still tired he he began the arduous journey down the flight of stairs that led to the family room. Adjescent to the stairs was the entry to the kitchen and front door. He felt his way through the dark until he found the
Page 4: kitchen light switch. It took several moments for his eyes to adjust but after fumbling around with the faucet he was finally able to quench his thirst with a tall glass of water. He then began with tedious journey back to his room. But before climbing

Page 5: the stairs a box on the counter caught his attention. It was addressed to him with bold somewhat metalic lettering. The box was not large, but could easily fit the new telescope he had begged his father for just days before.
Page 6: It was no where near christmas nor his birthday so he saw no harm in peeking into the box. 

As he began to strip away the tape the bound the box together he noticed that the box began to heat up slightly. This did not concern him
Page 7: due to the fact that he was too excited to see what the box contained. He was eventually able to open the box but what suprised to see that it was empty... or so he thought.... He then began to wonder why the box was heavy and why it was still warm.
Page 8: Inside and out the box seemed like any other. 
He closed the box and began to walk away when he heard a sound behind him. The box was humming... still not scared he returned to the box and listened closer. He noticed that the humming
Page 9: was actually the faint grinding of gears and cogs. Now quite curious he opened the box again to his suprise that yet again it was empty. Confounded he picked the box up and shook it. He threw it at the wall and it made a strange thud, as if it was made of
Page 10: something much denser than a simple box. Frustrated he fetched the box and began to look closer to the interior. He picked the box up and stuck his head in to get a closer look. The box seemed... bigger on the inside. In fact it was so big on the inside 
Page 11: that as he let the box drop straight down over his head his whole body fit into it. Now he was scared, screaming in fact. The box kept falling, or maybe he was... he could not tell. Falling and falling, expanding on all sides.... he yelled for his father
Page 12: to no avail.

Once he got a good look around he noticed that he was in fact falling towards a dim light in the distance. It seemed like several minutes had passed and yet he was still falling. It became apparent however
Page 13: that there was in fact several lights in this box, many thousands of them. Small and far away they looked like stars in the nights sky. Millions of stars al around him and he was falling straight towards one, falling at greater and greater speeds.
Page 14: Closer now he saw the light was in fact a star. A giant blazing ball of fire in space... and he was falling straight into it.....

The next morning his father came into the kitchen to make breakfast. His father noticed the box that arrived for his son
Page 15: the night before was on the floor and was open. Frustrated he called out for Mogand demanding an answer for why the box had been so carelessly thrown to the ground. As he picked it up he felt suprised as to the boxes weight. He was even more suprised when
Page 16: he turned the box over as the box was seemingly empty...

There was still no answer from his son so he went to Mogand's room and knocked. Still no answer, so he entered. The room was as it always was, messy. But the bed was empty...
Page 17: Concerned now he searched the house, but could not find his boy...

Page 0: The loud, defeaning knock on the wooden door of my classroom broke through the silence of my class like a rock through a window. My head whipped to the side, leading my frizzy, untameable hair to flip over my shoulder, making me feel like a supermodel on 
Page 1: runway. My eyes lit up at the sight of my favourite person. Richard Yang, my one, my only, the x to my y and the 12 to my 3x4. I rushed across the classroom, my bloated stomach bouncing with my love-stricken stride and my saggy breasts swaying from side 
Page 2: to side. I straightened my crooked necklace, so it lay straight on my warty, blackened chest and adorned the stretch marks I had recieved from years of begging for money off old men as a prostitute. Standing on my tip-toes, reaching as high asI could to 
Page 3: pull down the heavy handle of the wooden door standing between me and my one true love. 
I began to wrench open the door, my lips cracking into a smile on my saggy, aged face. 
"Richard!" I gasped, my knees knocking 
Page 4: together with clumsiness. I couldnt stand still with the man of my dreams standing before me.
"Citra." He mumbled. His faggoty voice blowing through the wind and downwards. I barely heard it, but the breathiness of his voice was enough
Page 5: to make my hanging vagina to tingle. I stepped backwards, gesturing for him to step inside. As he walked in, I shut the door, and walked slowly behind him, checking out that ass. When he stopped, I looked away quickly, and began to show

Page 6: him the mathematics I had written on the board. As he observed, I witness his hands slowly begin to move towards his inner thigh. I shuddered.
To Be Continued...

[3 Minutes Before]
 Twas 3 minutes before it all came down. I was sitting on the couch sweat beaten wearing nothing when I heard it coming. It opened the door, and turned out to be Puar. It came with a thrust all over my bust. 
Page 4: [Present]
I saw the Meteor flying down, ready for impact, and knew I had to stop it. I planned slowly and carefully, aligning my mouth perfectly to it. There was sweat on my chin when the red throbbing meteors head landed in my mouth. I knew this would be
Page 5: too much for one person to handle, as it was nearly 4 inches from the ground. The Meteor picked a target of it's taste, a busty tan girl with brown hair, that goes by the name of nrokin. It thrusted back and forth, and I had to act quickly if I wanted to 
Page 6: take down this meteor. I quickly pulled out my tracfone while battling this beast and texted my best friend Vic. You could describe her as very pale, but not as busty, with beautiful hair. She hurried over as fast as she could to help take down this
Page 7: meteor before we could put more people at risk. Victoria and I battled for the head of the meteor, trying our best to take turns, although the meteor kept beating us with it's stick, trying to tell us that it only has a couple of minutes left. That only
Page 8: meant we had to work harder and harder to take it down, and that's when it happened, the meteor exploded into a giant white shower of amazingness all over our faces, and we licked off eachothers faces, spitting it into eachother's mouths. We then finished
Page 9: it off by swallowing. They then spend the next hour or so entertaining themselves in ways TehSabbingSlayer would have enjoyed. They know it won't be the last meteor, so they will always be ready to take down another together, otherwise the whole
Page 10: world is at risk. The tale ends with two bare women feeling accomplishment in their life, very happy with the award they earned. Who knows how many meteors they will have to take on during the weekend...

Page 0: This will be a long read So, get down and get comfy. All that jazz. So, where do I start? Why did I do this? I have many questions to answer. Hopefully I can get the most of them covered.
Page 1: Let me note. That I didnt want to hurt the players. I planned the attack after a restart so there would be a fairly recent back-up to go from. I still care about you all and I apologize if I disrupted your first day of school or if
Page 2:  
my decision lead to a bad day. Also behave and be nice to each other and take turns slaughtering each other at /warp fightclub. Be nice to the staff. Try not to get banned.

Page 3: Yelling at mumble about how he runs his server would have done nothing. It would have been useless as it would have gone to the this is how i eat and thats it. Which, I understand, however as much as I understand. I dont support your actions.
Page 4: I doubt there would have been any civil way to address this issue.

I am not that hard to contact, my e-mail is tehsabbingslayer@gmail.com if you wish to remain in contact.

Page 5: RainCake: I know you might not think of me the best right now. Keep drawing!

Anywho. Lets get to business.

§lWhy did I attack muttsworld? Think of it more as me attacking mumble

Page 6: mumblerit has been increasingly abusive to staff and players over the growing months. These people spend their time and money on this server. Much quicker to say fuck you than thank you. He treats staff as if they are throwaways and pretends there are
Page 7: qualified people lining up to help Muttsworld.
The staff spend their time, most dont expect payment or any sort of reward other than the happiness that comes with helping people. Yea, its his business, however treating staff like shit typically ends up

Page 8: with them leaving or slowly becoming bitter towards Muttsworld. He wouldnt have to worry about staff miss-behaving if he actually treated people better.
All this could have been avoided if mumble was a tad nicer and didnt step on people

Page 9: all the damn time. Yes. I know he can do what he wants, however, I was not in support of what he was doing.  In my mind is a bit wrong, unfair, to ban someone for stating their opinion, true or false. The server got to the point where players dont feel
Page 10: safe expressing their opinion or thoughts.
We all know what hes like, we all know what he has been like. You also know what Im like.

*Threatening to ban staff, including myself, and let me note prior to this event.

Page 11: *Banning players because he didnt like what they said, in-game, forums, and because of comments made on Youtube.

*Right now people are purely being banned and/or harassed purely because they associate with me.

Page 12: I completely understand that mumblerit has the right to run Muttsworld the way he chooses. The one thing people often forget about choices is that they often come with consequences. I am also very aware of the many consequences that I will have to deal w.
Page 13: When I was administrator of survival, I cared about my staff and the players. Many of them I considered my friends. I still consider many of those people my friends assuming they wish to remain being friends with me.

Also, as an administrator of Muttsworld. If I did what mumble did. I would expect some sort

Page 15: of repercussion. If i treated the players like shit, treated the staff like shit. I wouldnt be an administrator. What sort of example is he setting for his own staff if he goes around acting like a dickbag?
Page 16: Mumble is making it look like I went crazy, yet his actions towards me and the players have lead me to this decision. Hes told staff to mute people who ask any questions about me. Hes trying to convince staff that I went crazy. Mumble knows exactly why
Page 17: I left the server. I gave so many damn warnings about leaving because of his behavior, I was so damn patient. I was attempting to wait for the oh it will get better sort of thing. *shrugs*
Page 18: Mumble is an asshole. No one stands up to him, no one tries to correct his behavior. If you stand up to him, youll get banned. You support his behavior when you play on Muttsworld and buy diplomat and other server perks.
Page 19: The average human life span is 80+ years. I highly doubt you want to be an asshole to people for the remainder of your life. What the fuck burnt you out so much to be a grump? If running the server is putting that much of a strain on you, then idk. Thats
Page 20: your choice and your problem and you need to determine on your own. I hope this is a lesson to treat your damn players and staff members nicer. Yes, xray is a bitch and a box to prevent and to prove. I even know this, Ive run across many mining tunnels o
Page 21: xray, scratching my head and wondering Is this xray?.
tl;dr: Im not giving any of my free-time, regardless of payment, to an asshole. It . Call me old fashioned however I value a thank you more than 2-5 bucks here and there.

Page 22: Im getting pretty tired of typing all of this out. Ill add more as needed. Im pretty sure I went around in circles many times. My past few months on survival made me feel highly unappreciated for the work I did. What do you lose when you tell someone
Page 23: thank you? Do you feel cheesy?  

I would not return to Muttsworld even if I was unbanned. Yes, I am indeed gone from Muttsworld. Ill be on a little server relaxing and chilling. Feel free to e-mail me if you want the IP.

	Title: Cow's Tale: Ch1
	Author: XxChaosIncxX
	Type: Written

Page 0: §9Prologue:

§0Despite the downpour,
Chaos boldy ventured
on into the woeful
valley of
blackened elms.

The sopping sounds of
his splashing feet
echoed into the still,
rain-drenched woods.
Page 1: The burdens he bore
were great, not only
those on his
back, but those of the
heavy toll of sin on
his soul.

Everyone. Not a single
peasant spared. He
mused over his
decision to kill
everyone that looked
like the damned.
Page 2: "Perhaps my judgement
was too harsh. Yes,
that woman really
meant no harm."

He chuckled in
remembrance of the
mass slaughter in the
peaceful hamlet.
Chaos was a hearty
paladin-cow.
Page 3: He didn't stop to think
as he systematically
purged the entire
town.
Penance must be paid

He was on a spiritual
quest to cleanse his
sins he had done in
the company of the
alluring man mage,
Zhalfir.
Page 4: §6Chapter 1

§5-Seven weeks ago, the
hour of the
tendercrisp bacon elf
sandwich.
Page 5: Leaning on the
banister of the
dwarven trade ship,
Chaos saw the Mage's
mighty tower from at
least three fortnight's
walks.

The knight-errant
Chaos had recieved an
ultimatum from the
Dwarven Council.
Page 6: The council were the
rulers of the kingdom
Stoutschmeckle.

Chaos was a simple
man-cow; a mercenary
with a fancy title, and
was by far no means
a hero. He sported a
draping moustache, his
bedraggled hair the
typical burly brown of
his highland homeland.
Page 7: His armor was of
modest leather and
iron, and by chance an
unadorned steel cap
sat atop his head.

No true knight was he.

His equipment
consisted of a sturdy
black mace and a
round shield adorned
with a blue spiral.
Page 8: An ample sack covered
his cape, full of
whimsical odds and
ends necessary for
survival in the world in
which he resided.

The nights were long
and the days were hot,
but in time the sea
voyage met its end.
Page 9: Upon arrival, Chaos
strolled off of the
gangway and onto
solid ground.

The wind whipped up
from the grey ocean
as he beheld the
impressive edifice in
its full glory.
Page 10: Grim clouds slowly
whirled about the top
of the looming
structure, as if by
some...magical force,
perhaps.

He trundled toward
the base of the tower,
and shambled up the
incline to the
entrance.
Page 11: Chaos paused upon
the last step on the
top of the cascading
stairway that led to a
somber, shale door
set in the base of the
stupendous monolith.

A feeling of doubt
washed over him,
quickly being shook
away, knowing he must
press on.
Page 12: He forged his iron will
anew into steel and
reached for the goblin
shaped knocker on the
left of a similar, troll
headed one. 

He recoiled in horror
when the statue's
eyes rolled about
madly.
Page 13: 
"Wahts we got here
Elliott?" the sentient
copper goblin giggled.

"I thinks its fresh
meat for the master."
squealed Elliott the
troll head.
Page 14: Shat-tap, bitch. You
sound like a shrieking
milkmaid who's just
seen a barewolf!
Page 15: "Oh, certainly," replied
the goblin. "But we are
only here to forewarn
the supple fools who
Master lures in.
Secure your ass
plate, noble knight! For
Master desires
manflesh more than
anything these days.

But business is
business, so says I.
Page 16: So enter, but 
remember us well.

For we are the only
pair of knockers you'll
ever see in this tower!
Hee Hee!"

The two copper beings
parted to the sides as
the gates swung
open.
Page 17: Chaos set forth in
determination. He
passed through the
foreboding entrance
and came upon a
crossroads.

Three halls diverged,
marked by troubling,
leering gargoyles. The
left probed deep into
the innermost clutches
of the burly ground.
Page 18: The one ahead
consisted of a
seemingly endless
hallway. The rightmost
path led up a
mesmerizing staircase.

Chaos' keen snout
sensed a moist wind
emanating from the
spiral staircase.
Page 19: Knowing that the
master wizard. Zhalfir
could only exist in a
solid state in sopping
climes, he turned and
began to ascend the
staircase.
Page 20: "Ware the seductions
of Master," the goblin
echoed from behind.
"Even the straightest
arrow can be bent!"

After the warning,
Elliott let loose a
squeal that sounded a
little bit like a fire
hose sprayed through
an electric fan filled
with pelicans and -
Page 21: whistling track
coaches who had a
little too much time on
their hands and liked
to play tug of war
behind the snack
shack but one day the
tennis kids came by
and tipped it over,
subsequently trapping
them in the tomblike
waste wallow and he
hated his life
Page 22: and all the days after
no one looked at him
quite the same way, not
even his family and
that's what Elliott's
scream sounded like.

Chaos ventured
deeper into the
labyrinthine halls. As
he progressed, he
began to fall into
a dreamlike state.
Page 23: The winding corridors
seemed to shift as
inexplicable enigmas
danced within his
primitive manbrain.

His rhythmic footsteps
were punctuated by
mysterious sounds;
sudden soft laughter,
or the quiet shutting
of a door.
Page 24: He felt a singular
sense of disquiet as
he strode ever
quicker down the
corridor, fighting the
trancelike waves of
unreality.

He was suddenly
aware of a vast
presence behind him,
and he whirled
around.
Page 25: Shield set and mace
drawn back, but
nothing was there, and
Chaos began to doubt
his own sanity.

§7(Certainly it wasn't
there in the first
place because he kills
a shit load of innocent
people.)
Page 26: Then a notion arose.
Perhaps Chaos was
not really wandering
the halls, not even
moving. Gods! 

He was wandering
within his own mind! He
must get back to
consciousness right
now, lest he wake up
with a sore ass.
Page 27: He struggled through
the blurring mire of
the dreamworld, trying
to reach out for
consciousness.

Finally, with all of his
will, he snapped back
awake, and found
himself in a dim, velvet
room.
Page 28: His armor covered in
rose petals, but
thankfully still on.

The Blaze of the
Glory




-By: axlgx
Page 1: Eveyone tells legends... Stories abbout monster, heroes, knights and old tales...
Some of them are true, otehr aren't that true. Ones scare, other don't.
but this tale...
Tells the Story of a Blaze, forgotten mobs of the Nether...
Page 2: Every tale starts with a 'long time ago, in a far place...', right?
This one starts with 'Not so long ago, in a place very deep under your feet..'
There was oncea Blaze, that was different from the rest...
Other had a golden skin tone, but...
Page 3: This one had a deep blue skin tone, like the one of a diamond, and shined like one. Other look like gold, this one, like a fresh diamond.
Nether venturers knew this tale, and believed that his death would give unlimited ammount of diamonds, so they went..
Page 4: after it The hunt began after the first nether portal in Muttworld opened.
The few Nether fortresses were destroyed while this was done, every single one. Grinders were made during this, in the wish taht it spawned a Diamond Blaze, and that never happened
Page 5: untill some years ago, when it spawned, killed and gave hundreds of diamonds. The owner of the grinder, known as Mumblerit, now runs the whole Muttsworld realm, thanks to the power of the enhanted diamonds that the Blaze of Glory gave to him...
Page 6: Thanks for buying and reading this book. Please, do me a favour:

Re-sell the book for its same price
(20 mums), and keep the flow of this legend. Good luck hunting the 'Blaze of lgory'!

/newestregion: takes you to the newest /village for new players.
Page 2: Guidelines on mutes:

1. Do not mute someone for personal reasons, a few caps, or as a joke. Do not mute them if they sent 2 duplicate lines, like during lag spikes. Do not mute them unless they are an obvious disruption to chat.
Page 3: 2. Don't argue with people in global channels. Keep it in /tell or local.

3. Always be in noob chat. You will hear a ding noise everytime a new player joins. Say hi, welcome them. Be nice. Pay attention to noob chat.
Page 4: 4. You represent the server so act like it. Don't be a jerk like the admins. Be nice.

5. Learn how to be trolled and get used to them trying to make you mad on purpose. Some players love to pick on the younger staff memebers.
Page 5: 6. Unmuting:

NEVER unmute anyone from noob chat. ever.

If the player can tell you why they were muted and apologize for it, then you may unmute them. If they don't know, talk to them until they figure it out.
Page 6: Most important rule:

Staff chat is not filtered. It is mostly 18+ and can be out of hand sometimes. If you feel uncomfortable in staff chat at any time just /leave st. What goes on in staff chat is kept in staff chat. You are not to repeat things said in
Page 7: staff chat! Its very easy for us to find 'leaks' so please keep in mind, staff chat exists for a reason.

Page 0: Hey GirlsRule139,
it's WolfGirl1901 here.
I was wondering if I could have a job at the Pizzaria.
I also have two horses that are wandering round that area. Lucky Clover and Golden Glory.
Page 1: I will work however many hours you want me to, for I could work in the Pizzaria or look after the horses ect. Whichever :P

If you don't mind, could I have one of them rooms like xXYoloJennaXx. Well, that's that.
Page 2: Hope to see you soon!



Best wishes,

- WolfGirl1901

§0sorry that I didn't tell you I built the stuff. I hoped it would be a nice surprise. Next time I will ask you before.§0
§0I have created my field on the shop bigger for the horses and such.§0
§0Also I have made my shop into a Equestrian centre,
Page 1: so it will fit in with the Pizzaria. I have also advertised the Pizzaria at the Equestrian centre.§0
§0
§0Btw, the Equestrian Centre supplies people with all the horsey gear, no human food. Though, golden carrots, apples and normal apples are sold.
Page 2: When you come up to The Equestrian Centre, hopefully Jester will come to see you. (Jester is the mule).§0
§0Well, hope to see you soon.§0

If you ever need new stalls or anything to do with the Pizzaria for horses, just ask :D

DEAR DIARY, 
ITs day two and i am traveling with DOGGIEGIRL3 then 
Page 1: were riding past a rivine and they got stuck in it so i had to get off and build them a long tunnel up and make it big enough fo rthe horse to go through.

DEAR DIARY, 
ITs day 4 and Mack2801 idea of house is gravel dirt a
Page 2: nd cobble stone mixed together. WE are stuck here and i think Mack2801 is paranoid that he is surrounded by zombies. BUt DOGGIEGIRL3 is as cool as a cucumber. But they always get really scared when they lose me on horse. And we keep running into rivines.

I just wanted to send you a note to say a biy thank you for eveything you did for me. Its not often on this server or on minecraft in general that you meet really kind people who are not trying to mess you around or destory your stuff...
Page 1: It was really nice of you to come by and take the time to let me show you around; then to have a grown up conversation (unlike most of the 8 year olds on here..) 

Sorry to go on and keep saying thank you but it really does make a difference
Page 2: If more people in this world acted the way you did the world would be a better place (cheesy as that sounds) You really didnt need to give me the stuff you did but you seemed happy to. 

And thanks for talking so highly of the house, nice to have someone 
Page 3: notice the work ive put into it!

I will try and find a way to repay you, maybe I could decorate your underground lair??

Let me know if you ever need a pair of hands or would like me to help with building 
Page 4: sorry to go on!

Thank you once again.

Hope to see you again

Kind regards.

Josh 
(aka ToffeeMidnight)

Page 0:         Prologue
  A half moon glowed on smooth granit boulders, turning them to silver. The silence was broken by the ripple of water from the swift black river and the whisper of trees in the forest beyond.
  There was a stirring in the shadows, and
Page 1: from all around little dark shapes crept stealthily over the rocks. Unsheathed claws glinted in the moonlight. Wary eyes flashed like amber. And then, as if on a silent signal, the creatures leaped at each other, and suddenly the rocks were alive with
Page 2: wreastling screeching cats.
  At the center of the frenzy of fur and claws, a massive dark tabby pinned a bracken-colored tom to the ground and drew up his head triumphantly. "Oakheart!" the tabby growled. "How dare you hunt in our territory?
Page 3: The Sunningrocks belong to ThunderClan!"
  "After tonight, Tigerclaw, this will be just another RiverClan hunting ground!" the bracken-colored tom spat back.
  A warning yowl came from the shore, shrill and anxious. "Look out! More RiverClan war-
Page 4: riors are coming!"
  Tigerclaw looked to see sleek wet bodies sliding out of the water below the rocks. The drenched RiverClan warriors bounded silently up the shore and hurled themselves into battle without even stopping to shake the water from their fur
Page 5: . 
  The dark tabby glared down at Oakheart. "You may swim like otters, but you and your warriors do not belong in this forest!" He drew back lips and showed his teeth as the cat struggled beneath him.
  The desperate scream of a Thunde-
Page 6: rClan she-cat rose above the clamor. A wiry RiverClan tom had pinned the brown warrior flat on her belly. Now he lunged toward her neck with jaws still dripping from his swim across the river.
  Tigerclaw

§0this is WolfGirl1901 from when we played together yesterday.§0
§0I hope you don't mind but I made your defending walls a little higher and fixed the entrance. The entrance was easily accessable to mobs at the time, they could just walk in.
Page 1: I also put five jack o' lanturns on the walls to scare away unwanted guests!§0
§0I'm hoping to create my farm in your area (if you will allow me to). I will take great care of the farm and your village. But I won't make any changes without your approval.
Page 2: I know it was wrong to higher the walls without your approval so I won't do it again.§0
§0If I do make a farm in your village, I will thoroughly respect your rules. Plus I will not change anything nor will I enter anyone's house without approval.

Page 0: Basic Sheep Care Guide§0
§0-------------------§0
§0
§0Welcome to the basic sheep care guide. Here you will learn the simple way of caring for your wooly friends.§0
§0
§0Next page ->
Page 1: In this book you will discover:§0
§0
§01. Feeding§0
§02. Health care and sheering§0
§03. Space and exercise
Page 2: Before we start, you're gonna want to know how to get your sheep!§0
§0Sheep can be found in the wild, bought from a breeder or bought on the auction.§0

Page 3: Sheep don't need taming, but they could do with a name!§0
§0Get a name tag, place it in the anvil and walla! You have named your sheep. But remember when clicking on the sheep, to only use right click ;)§0
§0
§0->
Page 4:        Feeding§0
§0Sheep, along with every friendly mob, don't need feeding all the time. If they do lose health, they are likely to need a nudge to kickstart their regen... Okay, that's a lie. Sheep only need feeding when you're breeding them.
Page 5: They don't actually need food to regen, tho, in some cases, they don't regen, which can cause them to die a lot quicker.§0
§0... So don't hit them ...§0
§0
§0List of things they eat:§0
§01. Wheat (Breeding)§0
§02. Grass (Main diet)§0
§03. Hay (They can't eat this -_-) ->
Page 6:    Health care and         Sheering§0
§0
§0Sheep have a very laid back easy life, (unless attacked by a wolf) so they are quite easy to care for. My sheep have a very calm life because we make sure
Page 7: no wolves can get at them. They don't have any health care really.§0
§0I do advise you sheer them every minecraft week, just to keep them cool (depending on your biome). If you're in the snow biome, it is best not to sheer them, just
Page 8: incase they get the chills.§0
§0
§0
§0
§0
§0
§0
§0
§0
§0
§0->
Page 9: Sheep like to roam, so why not give them a chance to do so?
Sheep love open fields so you could make them a large field. You could also put your horses in with them.
Sheep don't need exercise, mainly because they're always busy.
Page 10: But when my hand reared sheep, Smithy, was a baby, I use to take him out for walks on a lead, just like I do with my farm dogs.

I hope this book has helped with your sheep care!

Remember to pass it on.

Page 0: The Guide To Looking After Your Horse§0
§0------------------§0
§0
§0To get your horse, you can either buy in from a breeder, find one in the wild, or get one off the auction.§0
§0
§0
§0Next Page ->
Page 1: When you spawn in your horse you will need to tame it.§0
§0Simply right click on the horse to mount it.. But be careful! If you left click the horse, it will cause you to hurt it.§0
§0
§0->
Page 2: Your new friend will keep chucking you off as you tame it. Just keep mounting it and it will soon flow out a load of love hearts to show it sis tame.§0
§0One you have tamed your horse, take it to a safe area where you can mess around with it.
Page 3: I would advise keeping your horse in /stables when you leave the server, but when you're on, keep him/her in a large field to prevent it from despawning.§0
§0If you want more horses, either get another or find a breeder
Page 4: to breed your horse with the breeders.§0
§0I breed horses myself and have a range of paterns and colours to choose from. I breed race horses and high jumpers. But I also breed trecking horses, donkeys and even mules.
Page 5: My stud is called the Japanese Horse Stud, we aren't Japanese but pink_amy (my real life friend) built the house to look like it's from Japan.§0
§0
§0
§0
§0->
Page 6: If your horse is hurt, give it some food.§0
§0
§0Here is a list of things horses eat:§0
§01. Wheat (ideal for horses)§0
§02. Hay (You can't feed it to them)§0
§03. Apples (Favourite)§0
§04. Golden carrots and apples (For breeding) ->

§0When daddy showed me his bundle,§0
§0I saw it was a... Boy!§0
§0
§0Much older than I,§0
§0His face smuged and brown,§0
§0I looked on in horror,§0
§0I made not a sound,
Page 7: Dirty blonde hair,§0
§0With soft wispy curls,§0
§0His face soft with slumber,§0
§0I thought I would hurl!§0
§0
§0No Brother Of Mine!§0
§0I wanted to scream,§0
§0But stare on in horror,§0
§0I couldn't even breath!
Page 8: My daddy was delited,§0
§0He thought I was too,§0
§0He gave the boy my mother,§0
§0And she began to coo!§0
§0
§0I wanted to pout,§0
§0I wanted to cry,§0
§0I knew it no use,§0
§0I let out a sigh!§0
§0

Page 9: The days that would follow,§0
§0Were just as I thought,§0
§0The boy was a terror,§0
§0Yet still had my spot!§0
§0
§0The pride of my father,§0
§0He won right away,§0
§0The love of my mother,§0
§0She gave without save!
Page 10: When backs would turn,§0
§0The terror would rise,§0
§0He'd push and he'd tease,§0
§0And then smile into their eyes!§0
§0
§0The boy was much older,§0
§0Three years or so I'd say,§0

Page 11: My father took him every where,§0
§0My mother made him cakes!§0
§0
§0I was unhappy,§0
§0And very sad-bound,§0
§0I cryed all the time,§0
§0But this brought me frowns!
Page 12: Action I began to take,§0
§0And became a terror too,§0
§0No longer was it all for me,§0
§0There was war between us two!§0
§0
§0I never had to fight for things,§0
§0Things like a mothers love,
Page 13: But everyday the war kept on,§0
§0And I learned to kick and shove!§0
§0
§0       ~~~~~~§0
§0
§0Still yet a child,§0
§0Now seven years old,§0
§0He, not my brother,§0
§0Ten years and bold!
Page 14: His eyes they do sparkle,§0
§0The purest of green,§0
§0No longer was he teasing,§0
§0But boy was he mean!§0
§0
§0"Ten years of age,"§0
§0My daddy here told,§0
§0"So eager to learn!§0
§0Let's send him to school!"
Page 15: I was excited,§0
§0So very well pleased,§0
§0Send him to school?§0
§0Could this very well be?§0
§0
§0The day it had come,§0
§0The horror would go,§0
§0Off to a boarding school,§0
§0To learn and to know,
Page 16: I was the dearest of children,§0
§0To my mother dear,§0
§0Who hugged me to her bossom,§0
§0And drowned me with tears,§0
§0
§0She was so sad,§0
§0To see that boy leave,§0
§0I was so glad,§0
§0She only hugged me!
Page 17: The pride of my father,§0
§0Was harder yet still,§0
§0I was a girl!§0
§0And knew not how to kill!§0
§0
§0I practiced daily,§0
§0To sing and to knit,§0
§0I learned the piano,§0
§0I learned how to sit!§0

Page 18: I wasn't the boy,§0
§0That my father loved,§0
§0But I was a girl,§0
§0And knew all my stuff!§0
§0
§0A dinner was set,§0
§0For father's good friends,§0
§0Tonight I would play,§0
§0My spot I would win!
Page 19: I played as best,§0
§0As best as I could,§0
§0And smiled so sweetly,§0
§0I know it was good!§0
§0
§0Father's friends were all cherry,§0
§0And clapped at the end,§0
§0That boy was forgotten,§0
§0And so I did win!
Page 20: For years that boy,§0
§0Would come and go,§0
§0Each year bringing changes,§0
§0With more things he'd know,§0
§0
§0No more would we bicker,§0
§0No more he would tease,§0

Page 21: He seemed far more older,§0
§0This left me uneased!§0

Page 4:      Introduction
=================== Welcome to potion brewing! If you're new, keep in mind that you need a brewing stand, glass bottles filled with water, and many ingredients, which vary depending on what type of potion you may want to create.
Page 5:      Introduction
=================== Every brewing stand has the capability to hold at maximum three bottles at a time, meaning you can make 3 potions for every single ingredient you add. Keep this in mind!
Page 6:   Base Ingredients
=================== These ingredients start all potions.
------------------- ?Nether Wart
?Glowstone Dust
?Redstone
?Fermented Spider Eye [Adding these to a water bottle will create a base potion. see page 11]
Page 7: Secondary Ingredients =================== ?Magma Creme
?Sugar
?Glistering Melon
?Spider Eye
?Ghast Tear
?Blaze Powder
?Fermented Spider Eye
?Golden Carrot

=================== Add these to a potion to alter their effects. -------------------?Redstone
[Increases duration]
?Glowstone Dust
[Increases potency]
?Gunpowder
[Turns into a splash]
?Fermented Spider Eye
[See next page]
Page 9:   Effect Corruption
=================== Fermented Spider Eyes will change a potion's base effect, often reversing it or producing a negative potion. A "corrupted" potion usually does the opposite of the original potion.
Page 10:       Base Potions
=================== Base potions, much like base ingredients, are the basis of all potions. These are the potions created by simply a watter bottle and a base ingredient together.

Sky Home

By Black Dewn
Page 1: 

Once there was a wolf living in the sky.

the skyblock server was a peaceful place to stay, so the wulfy made a home
Page 2: it rendered as smooth as it could be and had not much

but what he had was enough to live a peaceful progressive life
Page 3: he thought he was all alone until he changed his settings to far and noticed he was not alone

far away there were little homes at equal distance each one from another

with people leaving the same way...

	Title: The Guide
	Author: greennou99
	Type: Written

Page 0: §0§0~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The Moderator's Guide to the Muttsalaxy§0
§0§0~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~§0
§0§0       DON'T PANIC
Page 1: §0§0So, you've become a moderator, congrats! I know that when I became a mod they just kinda, made me one and told me to get to it, so I'm here to give you a wonderfully patronising walkthrough of all the crap you need to know.
Page 2: §0§0~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Tickets§0
§0§0~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~§0
§0§0-Welcome to hell
Page 3: §0§0We use a handy little plugin called ReportRTS, which is how people file /modreqs, as a mod you will spend long, tedious hours (I am joking) answering these.
Page 4: §0§0But how do I claim these mysterious modreqs?! I hear you cry.§0
§0§0Not to worry, that's the simplest part, first of all every so often type /check, this will show you open modreqs, they'll be numbered.
Page 5: §0§0Pick a given modreq, generally giving priority to the ones which are green (the green ones mean the player in question is online), and type /check (Ticket number), which will give you an expanded version of the text, then /tick (Ticket Number)
Page 6: §0§0Now unless something dramatic has changed since I wrote this, you won't have to answer any modreqs involving things like protection, if you can't do a modreq, leave it for an admin, if you are just unsure on how to do it, leave it and learn how to do i
Page 7: §0§0for future reference.§0
§0§0In most cases of player disputes and setting people on fire and whatnot, I'd say usually just use your judgement, we try not to ban too many people, but sometimes people just need to be banned, generally only ban if they won
Page 8: §0§0stop breaking the rules at all.§0
§0§0Now, I don't think that banning is so complicated as to deserve a section of its own, so I'm going to give you the command and hope that you don't go around eager to test out your newfound powers.
Page 9: §0§0/ban (playername) (Reason) - (Mod Signature) - Appeal at: §0bit.ly/MWAppeal§0
§0§0I should clarify that the mod signature should be something that is based on your name, for example mine is simply <green>. Just come up with one and stick to it.
Page 10: §0§0~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Grief modreqs§0
§0§0~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~§0
§0§0-Your garden variety modreq
Page 11: §0§0Alright, so you've logged in, no-one else is on and.... holy crap 15 grief modreqs, not to worry, you'll have plenty of practice doing these at the speed of light.§0
§0§0First of all, claim the modreq with /tick (Ticket Number)
Page 12: §0§0You're now at the scene of the crime, there should be a player there, if not briefly ask if it's ok to tp them to their modreq and tp them there. Ask our burgled compadre where the grief is and get out a piece of bedrock. 
Page 13: §0§0Why bedrock? Well, bedrock is the tool for LogBlock you see, the most useful plugin ever (except maybe worldedit, but more on that later).§0
§0§0Click around like a maniac with the bedrock and you'll see a list of people who have affected the block tha
Page 14: §0§0placed the bedrock in/broke with the bedrock. Now click a griefed block and the name of the griefer should appear, you now know who griefed, roll back the grief using the following command which you'll get very good at typing.
Page 15: §0§0/lb rb (player) area (area) since (number) s/m/h/d§0
§0§0So if I wanted to rollback myself in an area of 10 blocks in the last five days, it would be:§0
§0§0/lb rollback player greennou99 area 10 since 5 d
Page 16: §0§0Congrats! You've fixed the grief, ask if there's any more grief, if there is, rinse and repeat, if not, close the ticket, give the player a cookie and be on your merry way.
Page 17: §0§0Now in order to decide whether or not to ban the griefer I use the following method:
Page 18: §0§0If the griefer is on:§0
§0§0Tp them to the grief and ask them why they did it and try to get them to promise not to do it again, if they do then don't ban them but ban them if they grief again.
Page 19: §0§0If the griefer is on but doesn't promise: §0
§0§0I'll usually give them a ban, they can make a ban appeal later.
Page 20: §0§0If the griefer is offline and it's major grief:§0
§0§0Ban them, again, they can file a ban appeal.
Page 21: §0§0If the griefer is online but they just griefed three melons and a sugar cane:§0
§0§0Don't ban them, you can talk to them later if you want, but don't ban for minor grief, they probably don't even know what grief is.
Page 22: §0§0That just about wraps up grief modreqs, now we can get to the actual fun stuff, like...
Page 23: §0§0~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Worldedit§0
§0§0~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~§0
§0§0-So many crashes...
Page 24: §0§0Alright, //wand, you now have a golden axe, horray for you. Now, I'm just going to give you a basic little guide here because holy crap is there a lot you can do with this plugin, I encourage you to go and read a few tutorials.
Page 25: §0§0//pos1 - Sets position one of a cube§0
§0§0//pos2 - Sets position two of a cube§0
§0§0//set (material e.g. dirt)§0
§0§0This will set the selected cube to dirt.§0
§0§0Horray for six thousand blocks of dirt, lucky you.
Page 26: §0§0That's about as much detail with worldedit as I'll go into, it's too huge a topic for the remaining 23 pages of this book.
Page 27: §0§0~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Events§0
§0§0~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~§0
§0§0-It's a party!
Page 28: §0§0Host a spleef tournament, blow up someone's house (with permission), host anvilgames for a while.§0
§0§0All good examples of things you can do for events. Host them often, you don't need an admin on to have fun doing events. It keeps the players entert
Page 29: §0§0Alright, the rest is all pretty self explainatory, so now I will throw you unfairly and hardly prepared into the mysterious and terrifying world of being a moderator.§0
§0§0Have fun.§0

	Title: Sad Story 1
	Author: danceheads101
	Type: Written

Page 0: Once upon a time, there was a little black boy, (not being racist). he was with a family, half white, half alien, teh aliens said, come to my habitat, we will have "Fun" there.
Page 1: Once they got there, he realized he could not breathe (this is where you laugh) and so he dies, comes back to life, then dies again 2 minutes later because he was being possessed (sorry for mispelling btw!).
Page 2: So after that, he went back to the earth after he came back to life again, (amazing story so far huh?)
Page 3: Then he gets a new family, because the rest of the family...
Page 4: died. Once he got to his new family, he fell in a hole (SO SAD! ;())
he survived a 45 foot drop onto concrete.
Page 5: They thought the kid was God's Son or Jesus's Brother, but they were wrong, he kind of had heart attack 5 hours later.
Page 6: Pray for the little black boy!
Page 7: Remember, this is Fictional!
Page 8: Im not being racist, and im not racist.

Page 4: [Present]
I saw the Meteor flying down, ready for impact, and knew I had to stop it. I planned slowly and carefully, aligning my mouth perfectly to it. There was sweat on my chin when the red throbbing meteors head landed in my mouth. I knew this would be
Page 5: too much for one person to handle, as it was nearly 4 inches from the ground. The Meteor picked a target of it's taste, a busty tan girl with brown hair, that goes by the name of nrokin. It thrusted back and forth, and I had to act quickly if I wanted to 
Page 6: take down this meteor. I quickly pulled out my tracfone while battling this beast and texted my best friend Vic. You could describe her as very pale, but not as busty, with beautiful hair. She hurried over as fast as she could to help take down this
Page 7: meteor before we could put more people at risk. Victoria and I battled for the head of the meteor, trying our best to take turns, although the meteor kept beating us with it's stick, trying to tell us that it only has a couple of minutes left. That only
Page 8: meant we had to work harder and harder to take it down, and that's when it happened, the meteor exploded into a giant white shower of amazingness all over our faces, and we licked off eachothers faces, spitting it into eachother's mouths. We then finished

§0§0  On one chilly day, Greennao, walked the streets of Redstone as he aproached a small store. He entered the little shop, welcomed by its warmth. Taking off his outer layers revealing a plaid sweater
Page 3: §0§0and his classic blue jeans. He walks in line, nervous by being surrounded by so many people. §0
§0§0  Meanwhile, a handsome young man named Puar. PuarZilla that is, enters taking off his coat and placing it on the hook lovingly. He winked at the young 
Page 4: §0§0sipping coffee while whispering their rumors. Puar smiled sadly passing by them. He knew he wasn't fit for anyone, no matter what he looked like. §0
§0§0  Puar entered the line behind the young fellow named Green. The two stood in silence studying thie
Page 5: §0§0surroundings without a word. Until Green turned around. His eyes met Puar's as he wispered, " H-hello." Puar smiled cautiously as his face flushed instantly. §0
§0§0 As the line progressed the became more fond of each other. 
Page 6: §0§0Reaching the counter. Green orders a cup of Sugar Tea, and Puar black coffee with a hint of peppermint creme. §0
§0§0  The two sit. Sipping thier bevrages peacefully. Green looks at his candy stirrer... §0
§0§0 Innocently he licks it. Tasting the color

§0§0 Puar helplessly watches enthused as the tease continues.§0
§0§0 Green looking up realizes what he has been doing and blushes. His candied lips parting, but no words coming out. §0

Page 4: §0§0[Present]§0
§0§0I saw the Meteor flying down, ready for impact, and knew I had to stop it. I planned slowly and carefully, aligning my mouth perfectly to it. There was sweat on my chin when the red throbbing meteors head landed in my mouth. I knew this
Page 5: §0§0too much for one person to handle, as it was nearly 4 inches from the ground. The Meteor picked a target of it's taste, a busty tan girl with brown hair, that goes by the name of nrokin. It thrusted back and forth, and I had to act quickly if I wanted 
Page 6: §0§0take down this meteor. I quickly pulled out my tracfone while battling this beast and texted my best friend Vic. You could describe her as very pale, but not as busty, with beautiful hair. She hurried over as fast as she could to help take down this
Page 7: §0§0meteor before we could put more people at risk. Victoria and I battled for the head of the meteor, trying our best to take turns, although the meteor kept beating us with it's stick, trying to tell us that it only has a couple of minutes left. That onl
Page 8: §0§0meant we had to work harder and harder to take it down, and that's when it happened, the meteor exploded into a giant white shower of amazingness all over our faces, and we licked off eachothers faces, spitting it into eachother's mouths. We then finis

Page 2: On a morning that began with a light shower of rain, two beings had laid eyes on eachother. Curiosity had formed in those beings and they began to move closer and closer to eachother when a morning with rain came. Days had passed and inches were cast away
Page 3: as they moved closer. Winds and clouds both tried to keep them parted though none had suceeded. Once they were close enough, the reality of the sutiation became clear, no words could be spoken. The largest one moved above his new friend and showed off his
Page 4: bright colors, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, voilet. These colors dazed and fascinated the smaller one; yes, these beings are rainbows, rainbows who found likeness and love in one another. As they moved closer to eachother, their colors could be felt,
Page 5: the hot red from the smaller one gave off a certain feel to the voilet of the larger rainbow, their two colors began to mix and blend, both feeling their love beginning to express. Alas, their passionate mixing could not last forever, once that bright sun
Page 6: peeked through the clouds, nothing could stop it; finally, as their colors fully mixed, they felt a wave of heat wash over them. No, it was not the sun, it was their passion for eachother, their love forever expressed through their colors. The sun could

Page 0: Out of the night that covers me,
Black as the Pit from pole to pole,
I thank whatever gods may be
For my unconquerable soul.
Page 1: In the fell clutch of circumstance
I have not winced nor cried aloud.
Under the bludgeonings of chance
My head is bloody, but unbowed.
Page 2: Beyond this place of wrath and tears
Looms but the Horror of the shade,
And yet the menace of the years
Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.

How charged with punishments the scroll.
I am the master of my fate:

Page 0: Dear PuarZilla,

Or should I say Aaron, I would just like to thank you for accepting our publishing deal for the newly written novel "Armagetiton!". It was a blast working with the producers of the film to create this one-of-a-kind novel.
Page 1: We had a blast creating it, although the real mastermind behind all of this is not the Gracious Host, nrokin, but you, the magnificent ruler of Muttsworld (or soon to be). Now to start this off, I would just like to mention how much I would like to choke
Page 2: myself with your hair. After that, I would love to take you out to a wonderful dinner in downtown Brooklyn, my hometown, I have a lot of gang members that can get me a discount at this 1.5 star resturaunt. Are you into anything, specifically hamsters? 
Page 3: Because there is a lot of things we can do together involving hamsters... Oh, and don't get me started on Admins in swimsuits. To finish this letter off, I would just like to tell you that I am your #1 fan, and if any fucker says that THEY are #1, tell me
Page 4: their name and I will personally take care of them myself. Our love can only grow stronger and closer, baby.

XOXOXO,
BenCarreiro

Page 2: Audrey was a tall, long-haired brunette with brown eyes and the face of a goddess. She was everyone's dream. Unfortunately for the male population this woman was blessed with the curse of being a lesbian. Countless men and women were dumbstruck by her
Page 3: looks. The dominate, aggressive, Audrey had no preference for men. She enjoyed taking submissive women and turning them into her playtoys for the evening.

Audrey went to a coffee shop to get coffee. What the hell else would she get at
Page 4: a coffee shop? Condoms? NO. However, there was this cute girl named Sofia. She had a soft-round cute face. One you could fuck all night to.

Now that we have the two main characters in the scene. Let's get to the hot and sexy part. The shower....
Page 5: LLOOL JK WHO HAS SEX IN A SHOWER.

	Author: XxChaosIncxX
	Type: Written

Page 0: §9Prologue:

§0Despite the downpour,
Chaos boldy ventured
on into the woeful
valley of
blackened elms.

The sopping sounds of
his splashing feet
echoed into the still,
rain-drenched woods.
Page 1: The burdens he bore
were great, not only
those on his
back, but those of the
heavy toll of sin on
his soul.

Everyone. Not a single
peasant spared. He
mused over his
decision to kill
everyone that looked
like the damned.
Page 2: "Perhaps my judgement
was too harsh. Yes,
that woman really
meant no harm."

He chuckled in
remembrance of the
mass slaughter in the
peaceful hamlet.
Chaos was a hearty
paladin-cow.
Page 3: He didn't stop to think
as he systematically
purged the entire
town.
Penance must be paid

He was on a spiritual
quest to cleanse his
sins he had done in
the company of the
alluring man mage,
Zhalfir.
Page 4: §6Chapter 1

§5-Seven weeks ago, the
hour of the
tendercrisp bacon elf
sandwich.
Page 5: Leaning on the
banister of the
dwarven trade ship,
Chaos saw the Mage's
mighty tower from at
least three fortnight's
walks.

The knight-errant
Chaos had recieved an
ultimatum from the
Dwarven Council.
Page 6: The council were the
rulers of the kingdom
Stoutschmeckle.

Chaos was a simple
man-cow; a mercenary
with a fancy title, and
was by far no means
a hero. He sported a
draping moustache, his
bedraggled hair the
typical burly brown of
his highland homeland.
Page 7: His armor was of
modest leather and
iron, and by chance an
unadorned steel cap
sat atop his head.

No true knight was he.

His equipment
consisted of a sturdy
black mace and a
round shield adorned
with a blue spiral.
Page 8: An ample sack covered
his cape, full of
whimsical odds and
ends necessary for
survival in the world in
which he resided.

The nights were long
and the days were hot,
but in time the sea
voyage met its end.
Page 9: Upon arrival, Chaos
strolled off of the
gangway and onto
solid ground.

The wind whipped up
from the grey ocean
as he beheld the
impressive edifice in
its full glory.
Page 10: Grim clouds slowly
whirled about the top
of the looming
structure, as if by
some...magical force,
perhaps.

He trundled toward
the base of the tower,
and shambled up the
incline to the
entrance.
Page 11: Chaos paused upon
the last step on the
top of the cascading
stairway that led to a
somber, shale door
set in the base of the
stupendous monolith.

A feeling of doubt
washed over him,
quickly being shook
away, knowing he must
press on.
Page 12: He forged his iron will
anew into steel and
reached for the goblin
shaped knocker on the
left of a similar, troll
headed one. 

He recoiled in horror
when the statue's
eyes rolled about
madly.
Page 13: "Wahts we got here
Elliott?" the sentient
copper goblin giggled.

"I thinks its fresh
meat for the master."
squealed Elliott the
troll head.
Page 14: Shat-tap, bitch. You
sound like a shrieking
milkmaid who's just
seen a barewolf!
Page 15: "Oh, certainly," replied
the goblin. "But we are
only here to forewarn
the supple fools who
Master lures in.
Secure your ass
plate, noble knight! For
Master desires
manflesh more than
anything these days.

But business is
business, so says I.
Page 16: So enter, but 
remember us well.

For we are the only
pair of knockers you'll
ever see in this tower!
Hee Hee!"

The two copper beings
parted to the sides as
the gates swung
open.
Page 17: Chaos set forth in
determination. He
passed through the
foreboding entrance
and came upon a
crossroads.

Three halls diverged,
marked by troubling,
leering gargoyles. The
left probed deep into
the innermost clutches
of the burly ground. 
Page 18: The one ahead
consisted of a
seemingly endless
hallway. The rightmost
path led up a
mesmerizing staircase.

Chaos' keen snout
sensed a moist wind
emanating from the
spiral staircase.
Page 19: Knowing that the
master wizard. Zhalfir
could only exist in a
solid state in sopping
climes, he turned and
began to ascend the
staircase.
Page 20: "Ware the seductions
of Master," the goblin
echoed from behind.
"Even the straightest
arrow can be bent!"

After the warning,
Elliott let loose a
squeal that sounded a
little bit like a fire
hose sprayed through
an electric fan filled
with pelicans and -
Page 21: whistling track
coaches who had a
little too much time on
their hands and liked
to play tug of war
behind the snack
shack but one day the
tennis kids came by
and tipped it over,
subsequently trapping
them in the tomblike
waste wallow and he
hated his life
Page 22: and all the days after
no one looked at him
quite the same way, not
even his family and
that's what Elliott's
scream sounded like.

Chaos ventured
deeper into the
labyrinthine halls. As
he progressed, he
began to fall into
a dreamlike state.
Page 23: The winding corridors
seemed to shift as
inexplicable enigmas
danced within his
primitive manbrain.

His rhythmic footsteps
were punctuated by
mysterious sounds;
sudden soft laughter,
or the quiet shutting
of a door.
Page 24: He felt a singular
sense of disquiet as
he strode ever
quicker down the
corridor, fighting the
trancelike waves of
unreality.

He was suddenly
aware of a vast
presence behind him,
and he whirled
around.
Page 25: Shield set and mace
drawn back, but
nothing was there, and
Chaos began to doubt
his own sanity.

§7(Certainly it wasn't
there in the first
place because he kills
a shit load of innocent
people.)
Page 26: Then a notion arose.
Perhaps Chaos was
not really wandering
the halls, not even
moving. Gods! 

He was wandering
within his own mind! He
must get back to
consciousness right
now, lest he wake up
with a sore ass.
Page 27: He struggled through
the blurring mire of
the dreamworld, trying
to reach out for
consciousness.

Finally, with all of his
will, he snapped back
awake, and found
himself in a dim, velvet
room.
Page 28: His armor covered in
rose petals, but
thankfully still on.

Chapters-
The Awakening 
Don't stop moving
There's no way out
My true form
The End
Page 1: The Awakening
--- ---------
It was then, I woke up. Gasping for air. My vision was blurred and I felt weak. I closed my eyes and tucked my head into my knees. "Please wake up. This isn't happening.." Tears flooded down my face.. I sat there tired and 
Page 2: confused. "Where am I? HELLO?" My high pitched voice echoed through the building. It was dark and I couldn't see where I was. I felt the damp air tickle my skin and I chills ran down my spine. The air smelt of something dead and of Earth. I stood up and 
Page 3: cautiously stepped foward with my hands in front of me, feeling what's to come. My footsteps sounded light but wet. After a few steps, my hand came to a cold stone wall. I felt slime oozing our from the cracks of the walls. I quickly pulled my hand away 
Page 4: and wipped it on my jeans. They're wet. Like everything else here.. 
Page 5: Don't stop moving
---- ---- ------
I slowly crept along the walls feeling my surroundings as I walked. Eventually I found a door. My hand carefully ran across the sides of the door in search of a way to open it. I felt a wooden hole and stuck my finger in
Page 6: it to pull it open. As I opened the door, I saw some kind of dim light. I quickly walked over to it to warm up, or at least to use it as a light. On the floor next to it was something stickey, I thought it was like everything else here and didn't mind it.
Page 7: Until the light rubbed some off onto my hand. Seeing it in the light, it was a reddish brown colour. It was blood. I was spooked and backed away. Starring at the now noticable corpse on the wall. I got closer to see the words carved on the torso.
Page 8: I read outloud "Theres no escape from me.." My jaw dropped looking at this horrific scene. I was scared. Nothing could be heard except my harsh breathing. I feel warm air on the back of my neck and freze in terror. 'He' was there. 
Page 9: There's no way out
------- -- ---- ---
'He'. Who is 'He'? Well I don't know. He's probably the guy who did this to the corpse. Probably the guy who trapped me here too. I work up the courage to turn around and face this monster.
Page 10: My light flickers as I turn and I hold it up to his face. My jaw drop. It's just a person. Like me. He's a bit taller than me, but he has dark hair and blue eyes. I'm still unsure if he's bad so I force some words from my mouth.
Page 11: "Are you the one doing this?" I mumbled.
"No." he said simply.
"How do we get out?" I said looking deeply in his eyes. He pointed over to the wall and replied. "There's a hole over there, eventually there's a staircase and a door. But it needs a key.
Page 12: I look at him as I walk towards the hole. "Is it safe?" I whispered. And he responded "As safe as this place gets." I climb through and he follows. Who he is, I don't know. But when in hell, everyone is your ally. 
Page 13: My true form
-- ---- ----
"So, how old are you?" I said. He said "I'm 19." My age.. hmm. He seems too good to be true. But I ask "When we get out of this, wanna get some dinner sometime?" He nods. We stop at the sound of footsteps. I look around to
Page 14: find nothing. He was gone. Whatever his name was. I'm all alone now. Scared again. My light blows out and I freeze. Suddenly I feel sharp pains on my arm only to realise claws were inch deep in my upper arms and we cutting my arms. I scream painful cries
Page 15: and then it stops. Whatever it was. it whispered in my ears "You're a dead man standing." And vanished. I fell to the ground bleeding in pain. I pass out from the sight of my own blood.
Page 16: The End
--- ---
I wake up. Not dead! And my arms are wrapped up with rags to prevent further bleeding. I look over and he's back. "My name is Daniel." he tells me. "I thought you were dead?" I asked terrified.
Page 17: "I just passed out." I get up in pain and continue. The exit. It was just open. I could see day light. I run outside grabbing Daniel's hand. "We're out! WE'RE SAFE!" Daniel looks at me and grins with a knowing smile. He then says "No one is safe." before
Page 18: sticking his fingers deep in his flesh and pulling it off, grey skin can be seen and bones show. He grins with his sharp teeth and with one swift action slits my throat with his long claws and drags the body swifly in the tomb. The doors shutting behind 
Page 19: him. My dying cries stopped as a hook was shoved through my back skin. Hung. He took his sharp claw and wrote in my chest "No hope." and watched me as I took my last breath.

Page 0: John woke up, he always woke up before any sound was there to wake him, but no-one would ever actually know that, he waiting on his bed with his eyes closed, going back over his thoughts from the night before, feeling the torrent begin again,
Page 1: the masses of information swirled around his head, it was like loud rock music being blasted directly into his brain and it almost always ended with him getting a headache. After what felt like a few minutes had passed, he heard the sound of his mother
Page 2: calling him from downstairs, there was some logic missing in this, he had long ago decided, as he always, without fail, got up fifteen minutes before he was meant to be at school, which was the exact amount of time it took for him to throw on his uniform,
Page 3: eat breakfast, and take the short journey to school. John's mother however, had never seemed to grasp this fact, and insisted on calling him down approximately forty-five minutes before he had to be there, despite him remaining in his state
Page 4: of psudo-sleep for another half and hour, he did not fail to meet this tradition on that particular morning. After the usual argument about this morning ritual had taken place, and no ground had been made by either individual, he lifelessly chewed on his 
Page 5: toast and made his way to school, he arrived slinging his bag onto the floor and waiting for the morning period to start, some people he considered his friends chatted amiably in the background about nothing in particular and he continued to sit there,
Page 6: not paying any heed, the teacher arrived and he stood up, his teachers name was Dr Smith and she was one of the few teachers in the school who seemed to have an ounce of logic, and therefore he respected her greatly, logic being something that was in 
Page 7: short supply in the world in general, still feeling that same sense of disconnecteddness he shuffled into the room and took his seat, he took out a pad of paper and absently began to write, not paying any particular attention to what he wrote, he looked
Page 8: down and proclaimed it to be garbage and scrunched it up and shoved it in a pocket for either some further use later or to be thrown away, he played with his pen, only pausing in his thoughts to respond to his name being called, he was struck by a sudden 
Page 9: and totally irrational sadness, his mind helpfully threw up some images of the worst events he could think about and his hands started to shake, he stilled them with a concious mental effort and began trying to focus on what the teacher was saying, the
Page 10: words slipping out of his mind, he suffered from working and short term memory issues, that was what the report said anyway, his attention rapidly diminished and he went back to his pen, which he looked at sadly and put away, his friend said something
Page 11: to him which he responded to without thinking, he was suddenly and without any kind of warning very irritated by this and wanted to be alone. It was horrible, the way he viewed the world constantly shifting and changing, with no reason or method.
Page 12: He wanted to scream and run out of the classroom, and finally break down and let his emotions run, but he never would, he had to keep up the appearence of sanity, or what was left of it, people did notice his strangeness, he was an oddity and could never
Page 13: seem to say the right thing, he glared enviously at the people to whom the right things to say seemed to come so easily, he attempted to smile and only managed to make his face scrunch into something horrible, people gave him odd looks and he tried to
Page 14: cover it with a signature manic smile, he would rather let it be known that he was odd that let people know he just couldn't do it, his face wouldn't do what he wanted it to, and it always ended up looking stupid, inappropriate, or both.


Page 15: The bell rang, waking John from his idle musings, he grabbed his bag and made his way to the biology classroom. The rest of the day was filled with idle conversation with the few people who wanted to talk to him, or at least were willing to, and the
Page 16: scratching of his pen on paper, writing words, but never the ones that he wanted to write, words without meaning.

The clock lazily swung its hands towards the ending of the day, and he swung his backpack onto his back. When he got home he went on
Page 17: his computer, looking at several things that did make him laugh internally, he was not humourless, as some people thought, it was just that he was never really able to express his joy, or at least that was what he told himself. His mother greeted him when
Page 18: he got home and he dutifully filled out the expected role and said his day was fine with a forced smile, people irritated him, it wasn't their fault, they just did what they were expected to do, they filled their roles, because they had never been taught 
Page 19: that they were allowed to become more than what was expected, to think outside the box and actually act on those obscure concepts such as 'making the world a better place'. John could never do that, not since he had realised that he didn't have to, but it
Page 20: still got to him, not that people rejected him for it, it would take more than that to break his will, but more the shrugs of indifference that they expressed, like they had seen it before, he was just another kid who thought rebellion was as simple as
Page 21: declaring yourself different and wearing black, but he never intended to do that, he wanted to go out and face the darkness of the world, force it to confront him, but the world would not listen.

Page 0: okay, guys. Out of pure boredom (and restlessness) i've decided we should move. I've explored a little and gathered all our absolute necessities for our next house. I also made some travel supplies so we don't get slaughtered and lose all our crap. 
Page 1: It's technically up to you guys whether or not we go; i've already made up my mind. The thing is, where WOULD we go? I wanna go check out that ice-spikes biome off to the north-west. It's pretty desolate though, which also means there is an abundance of
Page 2: resources and space. Let's be honest, it's getting pretty crowded here, what with the ENORMOUS castle being contructed next to us. 'sup to you all. Either way i'm leaving XD!

Make your decisions soon.

Page 0: HOW TO GAIN RESPECT IN MUTTSWORLD

1. Obey the rules

2. Don't spam

3. Become a diplomat

4. Stay on for a while, try to come back and chat with others from time to time. If you
Page 1: are unable to come on sometimes try to get minechat. This free app enables you to chat while not on your pc but instead while on your portable device such as an iPod or iPhone. 

5. Make friends and have fun building or doing stuff with them.
Page 2: This will give you access to a small base of friends that could give you access to more friends in the future and grow your 'base'. 

6. Do NOT be an asshat and use the /me command all the time.

Page 3: 7. Be mature, this can help a lot.

8. If you're diplo try to chat in diplo chat more than global.

9. If you want to be more than a diplomat than try befreinding staff, so you can aim for ambassador.
Page 4: 10. If you are doing a staff application be a diplomat and try for ambassador first. Also, It's usually good to be on for more than a year to try fo that.

11. Post and comment on the forums. This way everyone on mutts will get to know you,
Page 5: not just the 'Survival Crowd'. It's good to know people from the different servers.

11. Join Teamspeak and IRC if you can. Sabbing is usually on so it gives you access to talk to her. Befriending admins are usually a good idea if you want to be an ambsdr
Page 6: 12. Once you are part of staff you people start to respect you much more. Take bkauf2 for example.

13. Play fair at the fightclub. People can lose friendships over this crap so just be nice and don't put on your md.
Page 7: Thanks for reading the tutorial on how to gain respect on muttworld. Try reading my other books including, "How to get rich quick" and "Scary Stories"!

Hope you enjoyed.

We are best friends. Don't say were, because people don't just stop being best friends. I was mad at you because you hadn't made time for me in the past three weeks, you were mad at natalya for making a tweet (which was ->
Page 1: about melissa by the way, not you, but she said 'if the boot fits')
and we stopped talking. That was a fight. I don't know what shit Melissa's drilled into your mind about "Drama" but it happens. people get mad at one another. and people get over it. ->
Page 2: There's no reason to hold a grudge. If you didn't know this about me, I'm not exactly a person who throws people out of my life. Christian always gets mad at me, and when he gets over it I am sitting here waiting for him to be my friend again. you know ->
Page 3: that, you've watched that happen over the past six or seven years. You've seen me get into fights with natalya. we are still friends. If delaney wanted to be my friend right now, I would start hanging out with her right where we left off. I don't hold ->
Page 4: grudges but I don't go begging for forgiveness either. I have run all over the minecraft world to find the materials to make this book and quil to write you a letter to tell you that I don't think I was wrong, and I don't think you're wrong, I just ->

Page 10: As for Natalya: Good luck to you. I've never seen her so thoroughly cleanse her life of someone. you are her best friend too. We need eachother, and you need Natalya, but Natalya doesn't need you. This isn't a bad thing, I'm not saying that you can't ->

fanfic

It was a gloomy day. Tnt was strolling the sidewalk on the way to PuarZilla's apartment. It was Valentine's day, the butterflies in Danny's stomach made him blush as he clutched the roses in his right hand. He 
Page 1: studied them as he walked. Counting one rose with each step and starting over again. Twelve more steps, twelve more, just twelve more. He tripped over a rock and his heart skipped. Danny was nervous but he kept himself together. He walked 
Page 2: onto Victor's doorstep. He rehearsed the words in his head. He wasn't sure how Victor would react, but he proceded and knocked on the door. Before he could knock a second time Victor opened the door happily. "Danny!", he smiled.
Page 3: "Finally, you're here come in!". Danny hid the roses behind his back and walked sheepishly into the living room. Victor followed. Danny looked into Victor's eyes. Their eyes locked but Danny looked away his cheeks tinted pink. Victor stepped closer to 
Page 4: Danny, holding his waist cauciously. "Danny," he spoke. "I've known you for a while now and-" Danny took the flowers from behind him and presented them to Victor. "These are for you.." he whispered. Victor took them and studied them carefully. "I love 
Page 5: them," he spoke "But there's something I need to tell you." He said as he sat the roses on the couch. "Wait," Danny said. He knew that Victor was engaged to Rebecca, it was morally wrong. Victor moved closer embracing Danny in his arms once more. "Rebecca
Page 6: and I..." his voice trailed off. "we're... no more..". Danny gasped waiting for Victor's tears. But he didn't cry. "I'm in love with another" he whispered. "Who?" Danny responded. Victor looked into Danny's eyes. "This whole time we've played
Page 7: together.. Just as friends. As brothers. I always knew there was something diffrent about you" Victor's eyes looked at Danny's lips, then back at his eyes. "You were so.. obvious." He drew closer. Danny blushed, he stood there loosely in his arms. "Daniel
Page 8:  I think..." Their lips brushed past one another. "I think... I love you" Danny met Victor's lips. They kissed warmly. The two layed on the couch. Entangled in one another. Victor removed Daniel's navy tee, kneeling over him as he slipped his
tongue
Page 9: into his mouth. Lust filled the air. The butterflies in Danny's stomach were gone. 



(2 Hours Later)

The two laid on the couch. Victor's arm wrapped aroind Daniel's waist. They 
Page 10: were soundly asleep as 70's rock played in the background.

Page 0: Today I waited for mother to go to the market. Brother wanted some warm milk for Lilly our cat. I'm too lazy to actually chop firewood for the stove. 

Sonny walked into the livingroom where Bobby was curled up in a corner. 
Page 1: "What are you doing?" asked Sonny. "I'm cold" shivered Bobby.
Sonny wrapped his muscular arms around his little brother. "You need to man up" he grunted, "You're 16". Bobby rolled his eyes. Sonny let go a little noticing how suddenly warm his brother was.
Page 2: "Bobby, you need a warm bath, I'll go fix you one" said Sonny as he got up and headed to the washroom. He quicky ran the water waiting for it to warm up. He thought about his shivering brother. His warmth. His breath on his neck. 
Page 3: He quickly snapped out of his daydream and turned the bath off. "Bobby your bath is ready" he stammered.
He got up and stood in the doorway as his brother tottered over virtually frozen. He moved out of the doorway warmly welcoming his brother into the 
Page 4: room. "Thank you brother", he shivered as he walked into the room closing the door so there was only a sliver of light escaping. Sonny left to go retrive a towel for his brother. As he returned he proceded to enter but he suddenly dropped the towel on the
Page 5: floor as he laid eyes on what was behind the door. His brother, forgot to pull the curtain closed. Exposing his muscular glistening body to the air. 
Sonny stood in shock. He tried to look away but watching his brother bathe... was so much more. 
Page 6: As he leaned to pick up the towel something startled him. His wrist brushed against the bulge on his jeans. "Wha-" he whispered shockingly. He didn't know why he had... the unspeakable. But it was uncomfortable. Trying to push it down he let out a gasp.
Page 7: Bobby heard him. He stood stepping over the edge of the tub and walked to the door only to see his older brother bent over looking up at him. Dripping wet and glistening Bobby looked down at his brother and smirked. "Spying on me? Face it. That's a new 
Page 8: low Sonny". Sonny blushed eyeing his brother above me. Water dripped from his thighs. His entire body exposed. He blushed. He stood up embarassed handing his brother the towel and quickly turning to walk away. "Wait," Bobby said as he grabbed his 
Page 9: brother's wrist. "Huh?" he turned around. Bobbly looked into his older brother's eyes dreamily. "Take a bath with me" he whispered. Sonny looked at his brother at first with lust then disgust. "No! What are you talking about?!" 
Page 10: "You know you want to...", he said seductively. Admitting to wanting to he walked in and sat on the floor. "What are you doing?" asked Bobby. "I'm not getting in there with you its wrong...". "Oh what are you talking about brother! You're leaving tomorrow
Page 11: why not a bath for old time's sake!" Bobby offered. Sonny tiredly stripped naked and sat in the bath with his brother. He pulled his knees to his chest and folded his arms looking down. Bobbly leaned over planting his lips on his brothers forehead. "Relax

Page 0: This is a book of a farmer by the name of chipmunk01. It started when he spawn into "Cavern Village", he went into the woods and found a huge tree house that went into the lake, the moutian, and the trees. So he thought that if that guy could make that,
Page 1: he could make something better in ways that it isn't. He made a small tree house and made a wheat farm next to it. and every time his fence got bigger so did his farm. chipmunk01 needed more than wheat to survive, so he went to the market.
Page 2: he bought melons, pumpkins, carrots, chacolet beans, and a friend gave him some potatoes. His farm was now perfect, or so he thought. He learned it can be sad to live a life with no animals. So one day he found eggs and a wild chicken. he held his breath 
Page 3: and tossed the egg at the chicken's head. (YEAH. Thats what u get for pooping everywhere you guys go!) chipmunk01 had cought the chicken in the egg (like pokemon with pokeballs but in mc with eggs I like to call them pokeeggs) and the egg became a spawn -

2. Each mob have certain amounts of health. (you'll see this when you hit them. Shows red hearts.)

Page 1: 3. Hit the mob, until their health is below half the hearts they have, or at half either way.

4. After the mob is at 50% health or below, then throw an egg at it. 30% chance you'll catch it.
Page 2: Note: Be sure the mob is at 50% health or below before trying to catch it, or you'll waste eggs on it.

Note: Once you catch it, it'll be labeled as a spawn egg, and you can spawn it anywhere you right click with it:)

	Title: Cow's Tale: Ch1
	Author: XxChaosIncxX
	Type: Written

Page 0: §9Prologue:

§0Despite the downpour,
Chaos boldy ventured
on into the woeful
valley of
blackened elms.

The sopping sounds of
his splashing feet
echoed into the still,
rain-drenched woods.
Page 1: The burdens he bore
were great, not only
those on his
back, but those of the
heavy toll of sin on
his soul.

Everyone. Not a single
peasant spared. He
mused over his
decision to kill
everyone that looked
like the damned.
Page 2: "Perhaps my judgement
was too harsh. Yes,
that woman really
meant no harm."

He chuckled in
remembrance of the
mass slaughter in the
peaceful hamlet.
Chaos was a hearty
paladon-cow.
Page 3: He didn't stop to think
as he systematically
purged the entire
town.
Penance must be paid

He was on a spiritual
quest to cleanse his
sins he had done in
the company of the
alluring man mage,
Zhalfir.
Page 4: §6Chapter 1

§5-Seven weeks ago, the
hour of the
tendercrisp bacon elf
sandwich.
Page 5: Leaning on the
banister of the
dwarven trade ship,
Chaos saw the Mage's
mighty tower from at
least three fortnight's
walks.

The knight-errant
Chaos had recieved an
ultimatum from the
Dwarven Council.
Page 6: The council were the
rulers of the kingdom
Stoutschmeckle.

Chaos was a simple
man-cow; a mercenary
with a fancy title, and
was by far no means
a hero. He sported a
draping moustache, his
bedraggled hair the
typical burly brown of
his highland homeland.
Page 7: His armor was of
modest leather and
iron, and by chance an
unadorned steel cap
sat atop his head.

No true knight was he.

His equipment
consisted of a sturdy
black mace and a
round shield adorned
with a blue spiral.
Page 8: An ample sack covered
his cape, full of
whimsical odds and
ends necessary for
survival in the world in
which he resided.

The nights were long
and the days were hot,
but in time the sea
voyage met its end.
Page 9: Upon arrival, Chaos
strolled off of the
gangway and onto
solid ground.

The wind whipped up
from the grey ocean
as he beheld the
impressive edifice in
its full glory.
Page 10: Grim clouds slowly
whirled about the top
of the looming
structure, as if by
some...magical force,
perhaps.

He trundled toward
the base of the tower,
and shambled up the
incline to the
entrance.
Page 11: Chaos paused upon
the last step on the
top of the cascading
stairway that led to a
somber, shale door
set in the base of the
stupendous monolith.

A feeling of doubt
washed over him,
quickly being shook
away, knowing he must
press on.
Page 12: He forged his iron will
anew into steel and
reached for the goblin
shaped knocker on the
left of a similar, troll
headed one. 

He recoiled in horror
when the statue's
eyes rolled about
madly.
Page 13: "Wahts we got here
Elliott?" the sentient
copper goblin giggled.

"I thinks its fresh
meat for the master."
squealed Elliott the
troll head.
Page 14: 
"Shat-tap, bitch. You
sound like a shrieking
milkmaid who's just
seen a barewolf!"
retorted the goblin.
"What say you, you
magical trickeries and
metallic neon-eyed
fiends?" probed
Chaos.
"Am I not entitled to
enter the tower?"
Page 15: "Oh, certainly," replied
the goblin. "But we are
only here to forewarn
the supple fools who
Master lures in.
Secure your ass
plate, noble knight! For
Master desires
manflesh more than
anything these days.

But business is
business, so says I.
Page 16: So enter, but 
remember us well.

For we are the only
pair of knockers you'll
ever see in this tower!
Hee Hee!"

The two copper beings
parted to the sides as
the gates swung
open.
Page 17: Chaos set forth in
determination. He
passed through the
foreboding entrance
and came upon a
crossroads.

Three halls diverged,
marked by troubling,
leering gargoyles. The
left probed deep into
the innermost clutches
of the burly ground. 
Page 18: The one ahead
consisted of a
seemingly endless
hallway. The rightmost
path led up a
mesmerizing staircase.

Chaos' keen snout
sensed a moist wind
emanating from the
spiral staircase.
Page 19: Knowing that the
master wizard. Zhalfir
could only exist in a
solid state in sopping
climes, he turned and
began to ascend the
staircase.
Page 20: "Ware the seductions
of Master," the goblin
echoed from behind.
"Even the straightest
arrow can be bent!"

After the warning,
Elliott let loose a
squeal that sounded a
little bit like a fire
hose sprayed through
an electric fan filled
with pelicans and -
Page 21: whistling track
coaches who had a
little too much time on
their hands and liked
to play tug of war
behind the snack
shack but one day the
tennis kids came by
and tipped it over,
subsequently trapping
them in the tomblike
waste wallow and he
hated his life
Page 22: and all the days after
no one looked at him
quite the same way, not
even his family and
that's what Elliott's
scream sounded like.

Chaos ventured
deeper into the
labyrinthine halls. As
he progressed, he
began to fall into
a dreamlike state.
Page 23: The winding corridors
seemed to shift as
inexplicable enigmas
danced within his
primitive manbrain.

His rhythmic footsteps
were punctuated by
mysterious sounds;
sudden soft laughter,
or the quiet shutting
of a door. 
Page 24: He felt a singular
sense of disquiet as
he strode ever
quicker down the
corridor, fighting the
trancelike waves of
unreality.

He was suddenly
aware of a vast
presence behind him,
and he whirled
around.
Page 25: Shield set and mace
drawn back, but
nothing was there, and
Chaos began to doubt
his own sanity.

§7(Certainly it wasn't
there in the first
place because he kills
a shit load of innocent
people.)
Page 26: Then a notion arose.
Perhaps Chaos was
not really wandering
the halls, not even
moving. Gods! 

He was wandering
within his own mind! He
must get back to
consciousness right
now, lest he wake up
with a sore ass.
Page 27: He struggled through
the blurring mire of
the dreamworld, trying
to reach out for
consciousness.

Finally, with all of his
will, he snapped back
awake, and found
himself in a dim, velvet
room.
Page 28: His armor covered in
rose petals, but
thankfully still on.

Day 3 went kind of fast. The guy across from me, Galius, invited me to a party in the woods near here. I accepted, it's in a day.

Page 0: Horses

To tame a horse, try and ride it until it lets you...then when it does let you, keep trying to stay on until love hearts come from the horse.
      Put a saddle on it to control it, and armour to protect it.
      In Muttsworld, 
Page 1: use a golden carrot to draw one out of the wild, and finally, Donkeys/Mules cannot equip horse armour.

For horse materials, such as armour and nametags and saddles, even golden carrots, Speak To Slayer!

Page 0:        Sammich's
      Muttsworld
         Story



by Sammich98
Page 1:    Once upon a time,
there was a beautiful princess named Sammich. She was only a beautiful princess because her skin was Princess Daisy.
  She had discovered Muttsworld after some time of single player minecraft and played for a while in solitude and 
Page 2: silence. At some point, she got a boyfriend by the name of "mrawesome12345" or something of the likes. Then, after Minecraft dating him for a while he got banned, because his "brother" griefed. She still visited his house at /spawn 4 until it was no 
Page 3: longer a command and she was too lazy to walk from there. Sometime between then and now, she got active in the chat and was very helpful to the many, many noobs of Muttsworld. It was about 5 or 6 months of playing, and she made a staff application to be 
Page 4: an ambassador. That was when only mods and admins could reply to applications and anyone could reply to ban appeals. Sammich got quite positive feedback on the app, with +0.5s and +1s.
  Then.... after a month of the application being there with
Page 5: nothing but positive reviews, she logged on to Muttsworld and a friend said something to her in chat.
"huh?" was about what her reply was.
Then, the realization sunk in. She was an ambassador.



Page 6: Skip forward to April 2013, where she didn't play Minecraft for a month or so and got demoted. She basically didn't play much for a while, until the fall of 2013, when she got re-promoted to ambassador. So then, she played Muttsworld lots and lots
Page 7: as an ambassador, until one day...

Mumblerit needed a shower, but no mods were on to handle modreqs.
"who wants to be a mod?" he had asked
A cry of "me!" was seen in diplochat.
Page 8: "lol" was all the beautiful Princess Sammich said.
"ah, sammich. perfect" was about what mumblerit had said.
So, she was a mod.
  Then, that brings us to where we are now (well, where Sammich is now as she is writing this), which is Sammich floating
Page 9: in the sky at /spawn.

Page 0: How easily I can be scared

Once at night time I was looking at pokemon glitches and to me they all sounded fake. I stopped reading it and tried to find a glitch in pokemon black to see if they were true. I came accross a rock that was blocking the way 
Page 1: in Undella town. I used surf to get around but instead of it saying feebas used surf it said MissingNo used surf. I had known about MissingNo for a while but this scared me to the max! I instantly turned off my 3ds and tried to calm down. I went and told 
Page 2: my brother but he did not believe me!
I even showed him but then I realised, I had actually nicknamed my feebas MissingNo so I could scare people if they traded it.
But one thing that creeps me out is the buildings in Black city have dissappeared...

§2   §0One night a woman went out for drinks with her girlfriends. She left the bar fairly late at night, got in her car and onto the deserted highway. After a few minutes she noticed a lone pair of headlights in her rear-view mirror, 
Page 2: approaching at a pace just slightly quicker than hers. As the car pulled up behind her she glanced and saw the turn signal on  the car was going to pass  when suddenly it swerved back behind her, pulled up dangerously close to her tailgate 
Page 3: and the brights flashed. Now she was getting nervous. The lights dimmed for a moment and then the brights came back on and the car behind her surged forward. The frightened woman struggled to keep her eyes on the road and fought 
Page 4: the urge to look at the car behind her. Finally, her exit approached but the car continued to follow, flashing the brights periodically. Through every stoplight and turn, it followed her until she pulled into her driveway.
Page 5: She figured her only hope was to make a mad dash into the house and call the §0police.As§0 she flew from the car, so did the driver of the car behind her  and he screamed, "Lock the door and call the police! Call 911!"
Page 6: When the police arrived the horrible truth was finally revealed to the woman. The man in the car had been trying to save her. As he pulled up behind her and his headlights illuminated her car, 
Page 7: he saw the silhouette of a man with a butcher knife rising up from the back seat to stab her,so he flashed his brights and the figure crouched back down. 
Page 8: The moral of the story: Always check the back seat! §0

Page 0: Hey kiwi. 
       Thank you so much for all the thoughtful presents that you gave me. I can't wait for x-mas. I have something big planned for us. I really like playing with you and hope we can do more gift exchanges!
Page 1: I know how much we both like to recieve gifts! I love to open them. U truly are my best friend for all u've done for me. I just want to let you know how much you mean to me. And I like ur sense of humor. :P
(Don't worry, we will be together
Page 2: long enough to help each other laugh when we stare at cute boys) :P. I love how you understand my jokes every time. You make me laugh everyday at school and I just want to spend a whole day with you during vacation! I just want to play mc all day and ft 
Page 3: you. We can talk and laugh and share funny memories about how I keep forgetting to put stuff away and random fun like that. I love how we can communicate in such a ways that no one else knows what we are saying and we will be laughing. You complete me
Page 4: and you make me look forward to playing with you and seeing you the next day. I hope all is going well in your life. Merry almost Christmas! I think we should exchange many gifts under the "tree" while we drink "cocoa" and sit by the fire.
Page 5: We can build a little place where we can decorate and use as a festive place. We change it every season or every holiday. We also need to work on the pet hotel and finish it so we can put our pets in the rooms.
Page 6: Story Time:

     There once was a little girl, shy and very quiet. Her name was "Mochi". She was born in a little town called Kiwiston and never left her city. One day, she decided that she would go out in search
Page 7: of some friends. She packed her bags and left Kiwiston. She travelled for many days and many nights, hoping to bump into a city that she could stay in. She was also hoping to make a friend that would help her out. The town was named
Page 8: Muttsland. As lil Mochi wandered around the town, she was thinking about how bad her life was. Then, she saw her. (Not the love kinda way) Kirwi was the mayor's daughter and soon to be the towns first girl ruler. Kirwi was a little girl that was SUPER 
Page 9: bright. She has light brown hair that flowed when she ran. Beautiful brown eyes with huge pupils. Although she was very wealthy and well-known, she too was having issues. She doesn't have many friends either. Kirwi then decided to leave the town
Page 10: in search of a place where she could make some friends. The day she was leaving, Lil Mochi and Kirwi met. "Hi Mrs.Girl", said lil Mochi. "Sup dawg", replied Kirwi. Lil Mochi was surprised that she was speaking slang since she lived such a royal life.
Page 11: "Wasup," Kirwi said again. "Hey.... My name is Mochi. And.... ummm.... I ran away to look for some friends.... i guess." Mochi explained. "Oh...My...Potato.... I am too..." said Kirwi. "do you maybe wanna be my friend???" asked Mochi.
Page 12: For a sec, they just observed each other....... "OF COURSE!" they both said.

From that day on, the two girls we best friends. Even today, they remain together. They promise each other they will be together forever.
Page 13: I hope u liked it lil kiwi. It was a little long tho.

----------------------

I will always love you kiwi. 

Love u lots! XOXO
:P            <3

   Once opon a time, there was a Pig named Kiwi, who was clueless.  Then there was a Rabbit named Michi.  Kiwi was blind, so she couldnt see! OH NO!  Michi was so nice she gave Kiwi glasses!  WOW!  Kiwi didnt notice that there were such 
Page 3: things, called glasses.  Then, Michi put the glasses on Kiwi and...
BAM! A creeper blew up... Kiwi says,"I thought we were on peaceful mode".  "We r those were fireworks," Michi said. "Oh yeah, I forgot!"  WOW CLASSICAL KIWI!  The glasses fell in lava. OH
Page 4: NO! But Michi remembered she was in creative. SUCH A SMART COOKIE! Michi got the glasses and put it on Kiwi!  And Kiwi noticed that a true friend was right in front of her.  AWWWW!  They became friends for the rest of ETERNITY!

	Author: jjp1234
	Type: Written

Page 0: Don't ask me what I'm doing here, because I don't know. One day, I woke up in the middle of a forest, covered in snow, devoid of all memory and sense of identity. Why? I have no clue. It almost doesn't matter. I spent the first couple of hours calling for
Page 1: help, wandering around hoping I'd fine someone nearby. After a while, I came to the reluctant conclusion that I was well and truly isolated: no sounds of human voices, no hum of tires on distant roadways; nothing but the trill of far off birds and
Page 2: rustling branches in the wind. There might have been a cow nearby from all the mooing, but I couldn't find it.§0
§0I might not have know who I am, or why I woke up in this snowy forest, but that didn't mean I was going to sit down and let depression take me
Page 3: along with the wolves. I needed a plan of action, need to find a way to survive. But first, a man needs to know himself before he can trust himself, and because my old name was lost to my departed memory. I have decided to call myself Steve. Its a good 
Page 4: name.I spent some time searching the area, looking for anything that might be useful to me. Tools and weapons would be my first priority--don't ask me how I knew, but I could tell the forest would be dangerous at night, I don't know why. There
Page 5: wasn't much, not even a single fallen branch on the ground, just smooth snow and straight pine trees. i tried to grab hold of a few rocks peeking up from the soil,but they were firmly stuck. I'd need something to pry them free, or maybe break them away. I
Page 6: spotted a tree nearby and went to it, running my hands over the dark brown bark. It was a good tree.. strong and healthy.§0
§0
§0So I punched it.§0
§0
§0Pulp and bark flew as my hard fists broke chunk after chunk.
Page 7:  I gritted my teeth against the jarring in my arms and kept going until the whole thing broke through and crashed to the §0ground.Chest§0 heaving from the exertion, I gathered the wood and sat down, examining the pieces. I broke some of the longer chunks into
Page 8: thick sticks, then stabbed on of them into piece of wood shaped like a blade.§0
§0I grinned as I hefted the wooden axe I'd made, then swung it around experimentally. It felt good. I used the axe to fell several more tress until I had enough wood to make all
Page 9: the tools I needed: a shovel, sword and a pickaxe--the latter of which I used to break those stubborn stone from the ground. I stowed the rocks away for later use and strapped the tools to my back. I kept the sword out though, the feeling of danger in the
Page 10: woods tickling the back of my mind. Thus armed, I set off in search of food and shelter.I won't bore you with the details of my struggle against starvation and §0wolves.Suffice§0 it to say, it was a struggle. I fought, bled and conquered. I stumbled over
Page 11: hills and down into water-filled valleys, climbing trees to see the path ahead. I slew cows and ate their flesh to stay alive.I fell off cliffs and broke bones, spending days waiting for them to heal. I briefly marveled at how quickly the wounds mended,
Page 12: but wasted no time in pressing on once they did. At night times, I was attacked by monsters, proving my intuition about the forest to be correct. I hid from the darkness, lighting the small mud huts I'd built along the way with torches until the sim rose
Page 13: once again. I never knew why the world I'd woken up in was filled with skeletons and zombies, but it didn't really matter, I bashed their heads in with stone swords nonetheless. There were more questions to be had than answers, and I knew I would never
Page 14: know half of them.§0
§0
§0I had to SURVIVE!§0
§0
§0Weeks later, exhausted, clothes ripped and torn, blood from numerous cuts on my legs trailing into my socks, I finally found mountains. Majestic. I climbed them each, looking for the ideal spot to build a home
Page 15: far away from the oprressive trees and monster-filled shadows of the forest.I avoided the caves beneath those mountains, fearful of skeletons and massive spiders.I knew I would have to venture inside them eventually, but no then. I finally found a flat
Page 16: topped peak that overlooked the forests to the eats, and the ocean to the west. From its heights, I would be able to see the while land, and defend my homestead from intruders.§0
§0
§0It was good.
Page 17: That was a few months ago. I've since become used to this way of life, in this strange land. The name of Steve fits me like a glove, and I am the master of my modest stone home. I've raised cattle, planted wheat, and baked bread. I've explored those
Page 18: mysterious caved and returned the victor,bringing home coal for fires, iron for tools and armor, precious gold and even a priceless diamond. I am king of all I see, master of this forsaken land And then yesterday, my house blew up.... The building in

[Verse 1]
Dog goes "woof"
Cat goes "meow"
Bird goes "tweet"
And mouse goes "squeak"
Cow goes "moo"
Frog goes "croak"
And the elephant goes "toot"
Ducks say "quack"
Page 1: And fish go "blub"
And the seal goes "ow ow ow"

[Pre-Chorus]
But there's one sound
That no one knows
What does the fox say?

Chasing mice

Tiny paws
Up the hill
Suddenly you're standing still

So beautiful
Like an angel in disguise
But if you meet
A friendly horse
Will you communicate by

Ancient mystery
Somewhere deep in the woods
I know you're hiding
What is your sound?

Hiding in the woods

	Title: Cow's Tale: Ch1
	Author: XxChaosIncxX
	Type: Written

Page 0: §9Prologue:

§0Despite the downpour,
Chaos boldy ventured
on into the woeful
valley of
blackened elms.

The sopping sounds of
his splashing feet
echoed into the still,
rain-drenched woods.
Page 1: The burdens he bore
were great, not only
those on his
back, but those of the
heavy toll of sin on
his soul.

Everyone. Not a single
peasant spared. He
mused over his
decision to kill
everyone that looked
like the damned.
Page 2: "Perhaps my judgement
was too harsh. Yes,
that woman really
meant no harm."

He chuckled in
remembrance of the
mass slaughter in the
peaceful hamlet.
Chaos was a hearty
paladin-cow.
Page 3: He didn't stop to think
as he systematically
purged the entire
town.
Penance must be paid

He was on a spiritual
quest to cleanse his
sins he had done in
the company of the
alluring man mage,
Zhalfir.
Page 4: §6Chapter 1

§5-Seven weeks ago, the
hour of the
tendercrisp bacon elf
sandwich.

Page 5: Leaning on the
banister of the
dwarven trade ship,
Chaos saw the Mage's
mighty tower from at
least three fortnight's
walks.

The knight-errant
Chaos had recieved an
ultimatum from the
Dwarven Council.
Page 6: The council were the
rulers of the kingdom
Stoutschmeckle.

Chaos was a simple
man-cow; a mercenary
with a fancy title, and
was by far no means
a hero. He sported a
draping moustache, his
bedraggled hair the
typical burly brown of
his highland homeland.
Page 7: His armor was of
modest leather and
iron, and by chance an
unadorned steel cap
sat atop his head.

No true knight was he.

His equipment
consisted of a sturdy
black mace and a
round shield adorned
with a blue spiral.
Page 8: An ample sack covered
his cape, full of
whimsical odds and
ends necessary for
survival in the world in
which he resided.

The nights were long
and the days were hot,
but in time the sea
voyage met its end.
Page 9: Upon arrival, Chaos
strolled off of the
gangway and onto
solid ground.

The wind whipped up
from the grey ocean
as he beheld the
impressive edifice in
its full glory.
Page 10: Grim clouds slowly
whirled about the top
of the looming
structure, as if by
some...magical force,
perhaps.

He trundled toward
the base of the tower,
and shambled up the
incline to the
entrance.
Page 11: Chaos paused upon
the last step on the
top of the cascading
stairway that led to a
somber, shale door
set in the base of the
stupendous monolith.

A feeling of doubt
washed over him,
quickly being shook
away, knowing he must
press on.
Page 12: He forged his iron will
anew into steel and
reached for the goblin
shaped knocker on the
left of a similar, troll
headed one. 

He recoiled in horror
when the statue's
eyes rolled about
madly.
Page 13: "Wahts we got here
Elliott?" the sentient
copper goblin giggled.

"I thinks its fresh
meat for the master."
squealed Elliott the
troll head.
Page 14: Shat-tap, bitch. You
sound like a shrieking
milkmaid who's just
seen a barewolf!
Page 15: "Oh, certainly," replied
the goblin. "But we are
only here to forewarn
the supple fools who
Master lures in.
Secure your ass
plate, noble knight! For
Master desires
manflesh more than
anything these days.

But business is
business, so says I.
Page 16: So enter, but 
remember us well.

For we are the only
pair of knockers you'll
ever see in this tower!
Hee Hee!"

The two copper beings
parted to the sides as
the gates swung
open.
Page 17: Chaos set forth in
determination. He
passed through the
foreboding entrance
and came upon a
crossroads.

Three halls diverged,
marked by troubling,
leering gargoyles. The
left probed deep into
the innermost clutches
of the burly ground.
Page 18: The one ahead
consisted of a
seemingly endless
hallway. The rightmost
path led up a
mesmerizing staircase.

Chaos' keen snout
sensed a moist wind
emanating from the
spiral staircase.
Page 19: Knowing that the
master wizard. Zhalfir
could only exist in a
solid state in sopping
climes, he turned and
began to ascend the
staircase.
Page 20: "Ware the seductions
of Master," the goblin
echoed from behind.
"Even the straightest
arrow can be bent!"

After the warning,
Elliott let loose a
squeal that sounded a
little bit like a fire
hose sprayed through
an electric fan filled
with pelicans and -
Page 21: whistling track
coaches who had a
little too much time on
their hands and liked
to play tug of war
behind the snack
shack but one day the
tennis kids came by
and tipped it over,
subsequently trapping
them in the tomblike
waste wallow and he
hated his life
Page 22: and all the days after
no one looked at him
quite the same way, not
even his family and
that's what Elliott's
scream sounded like.

Chaos ventured
deeper into the
labyrinthine halls. As
he progressed, he
began to fall into
a dreamlike state.
Page 23: The winding corridors
seemed to shift as
inexplicable enigmas
danced within his
primitive manbrain.

His rhythmic footsteps
were punctuated by
mysterious sounds;
sudden soft laughter,
or the quiet shutting
of a door.
Page 24: He felt a singular
sense of disquiet as
he strode ever
quicker down the
corridor, fighting the
trancelike waves of
unreality.

He was suddenly
aware of a vast
presence behind him,
and he whirled
around.
Page 25: Shield set and mace
drawn back, but
nothing was there, and
Chaos began to doubt
his own sanity.

§7(Certainly it wasn't
there in the first
place because he kills
a shit load of innocent
people.)
Page 26: Then a notion arose.
Perhaps Chaos was
not really wandering
the halls, not even
moving. Gods! 

He was wandering
within his own mind! He
must get back to
consciousness right
now, lest he wake up
with a sore ass.

Page 27: He struggled through
the blurring mire of
the dreamworld, trying
to reach out for
consciousness.

Finally, with all of his
will, he snapped back
awake, and found
himself in a dim, velvet
room.
Page 28: His armor covered in
rose petals, but
thankfully still on.

Page 4:      Introduction
=================== Welcome to potion brewing! If you're new, keep in mind that you need a brewing stand, glass bottles filled with water, and many ingredients, which vary depending on what type of potion you may want to create.
Page 5:      Introduction
=================== Every brewing stand has the capability to hold at maximum three bottles at a time, meaning you can make 3 potions for every single ingredient you add. Keep this in mind!
Page 6:   Base Ingredients
=================== These ingredients start all potions.
------------------- ?Nether Wart
?Glowstone Dust
?Redstone
?Fermented Spider Eye [Adding these to a water bottle will create a base potion. see page 11]
Page 7: Secondary Ingredients =================== ?Magma Creme
?Sugar
?Glistering Melon

?Fermented Spider Eye
[See next page]
Page 9:   Effect Corruption
=================== Fermented Spider Eyes will change a potion's base effect, often reversing it or producing a negative potion. A "corrupted" potion usually does the opposite of the original potion.
Page 10:       Base Potions

§0Just got done looking at a grief site. Don't know what i should do about this, i modreqed it to a mod and he came and fixed it. But i fear this is going to get way out of hand.§0
§0This is the second time now, heck knows if this is the fifth time.
Page 1: All i know is i just searched the one who did it this time, NerfJedi. I knew the griefing was an inside job from the first time i laid eyes on it. Now i fear this is a classified investigation now.
Page 2: NerfJedi has chests, ALOT of them. And they all seem to have been protected, and that's not it, they are all also given permission by the one and only person who lives wit him, lejonlover. After a talk with the mod about it, he said that he had it handled
Page 3: .But i don't think he does. I'm going to investigate this inside job griefing rampage and see what's going on. 
Page 4: Turns out it was a false alarm, but that doesn't mean i'm wrong. there still could be some griefer creed. I'm still investigating.§0

What is Laveyan satanism? 
Page 1: Neo (laveyan) satanism is also known as Athiestic satanism, its a selfish non thiestic religion that teaches social darwinism and egoism. Social darwinism is the idea that we apply the concept of natural selection to our society. "Only the strong survive"
Page 2: This idea is rejected by most rational people due to its total abandon of human nature. Our society makes it near impossible for natural selection to occur. 
Lavayan satanism has seven tenants or laws, as well as seven "sins" 
Page 3: Laveyan satanism also condones the practice of "magick". They believe that a man or womans willpower in thought can effect the physical world. They worship more the idea of a literary satan. Unlike thiestic satanism or "luciferianism" 
Page 4: There are multiple sects of modern satanism, the sect i am a member or is known as The Satanic Temple. We reject the ideas of social darwininism,Magick and egoism. We instead take a more humanistic approach. Our sect is based primarily in the united state
Page 5: We use our constitutional right to freedom of religion in order to oppose laws that threaten the seperation of church and state or are otherwise unreasonable. We are, in essence a psuedo religious organization who use legal technicalities to fight
Page 6: religious oppression.  The moral of this short pamphlet is....

Page 0: A long long time ago (yesterday) there was a girl named Georgie, who went to Loreto College in Ballarat and she met a friend on the internet named Pran or "Aced Gaming". Idk how they met but they know eachother so. Yeah. ANYWHO from day 1, Pran has always
Page 1: had a crush from Georgie but he would never admit it, not even to his close friends. When Georgie introduced him to her 2 fabulous friends Caitlin and Bella, Pran got to know them and then Basically tell them everything that happened in Queensland (where 
Page 2: he lives). Most of this stuff was about his friend Ami, which till this day we dont know if he ever had a crush on her but he did tell Caitlin and Bella all of his problems with her and they just got sick of it but Georgie on the other hand, loved
Page 3: listening to his stories as she grew to have a crush on him. One day when she was typing to Pran, she meant to say "I hate you" as a joke but "Hate" autocorrected to "have a crush on". We dont know how this happened but it did. Before Georgie could say
Page 4: "Oops autocorrect" he quickly replied with "I feel the same way!" and Georgie was so relieved that she flew up to Queensland to share her first kiss with him. When she returned to Ballarat, her and Pran kept dating and when she Graduated high school, she 
Page 5: moved to Queensland and Married him. Years Later they had 2 kids named Bella and Caitlin and they named it after Georgies two most fabulous friends. They grew old together and died together, keeping the love.

There was nothingness until God (aka the Piink Unicorn) created rainbows. These rainbows made everyone happy (and a lot of people gay) But no one judged because this was long before society fucked shit up.
Page 1: ON THE SECOND DAY God created the Earth, it was pink in honour of the Piink Unicorn (before society fucked everything up) The Earth and the rainbow lived together in harmony as one (this included animals, water and all that shit because this God was fast)
Page 2: ON THE THIRD DAY
God created the moon, God was craving cheese at the time so she thought the moon was gonna fulfill her hunger but she fucked up. Oh well.
Page 3: ON THE FOURTH DAY
God created Man and Woman. That was the biggest mistake God ever had because these two were fucking the whole time and they wouldn't stop. It was gross. The animals were grossed out... Everyone's was grossed out.
Page 4: ON THE FIFTH DAY
God created the sun in hope of the woman and man feeling uncomfortable to fuck in broad daylight but nope! Those two people were fucking from day to night.
Page 5: ON THE SIXTH AND FINAL DAY
God created Jesus (Ie Caitlin) to stand in the middle of Man and Woman and make HILARIOUS jokes because CAITLIN IS LOVE, CAITLIN IS LIFE!

Page 0: Hello, i didnt came here to play as a normal player, i came here to acomplish what i started a year ago. what we started, Sabbing, chozo, creepy, me and many others. this wont have anny ''big effect'' and not long term one as well but you know, a castle 
Page 1: is made of thousand rocks so slowly we add them one by one. in case you dont already see it, im about to fly away like a damn phoenix, litterally, like in movies with a big ball'o fire.i would like to thank alot of people on here that helped me from 
Page 2: different ways ( money, materials'n shit) to help me get my achievement. If you didnt noticed yet, people are more and more complaining about the lag and you need to restart the survival world really often. this all caused by the 14 lag machine hiden all 
Page 3: arround the surviavl world ( mostly near towns and where most player go) they go from bed rock to near the surface. about 45 blocks long, these are 2 rows of pistons pushing gravel/sand. and that powered by a speeding clock. hope you guys find them soon. 
Page 4: (or not) Also, i went thru well know towns and spawned couple of withers, destroying and killing everything around. not much but still a brick in the fucking castle as i said earlier. by the end of all that, i strongly suggest you to change server, to
Page 5: stop playing minecraft or even just go on this server instead (199.192.79.10) in case you didnt got it, its sabbing's server. as She started her military service, i want to give her the gift of getting back all the fans she lost because of Mumblerit shity
Page 6: attitude toward his staff. I had a server for some time and even if im not that experimented, i know there are things thats you DONT say to people, even if you dont know them ''irl'' shit still hurt thru that screen. And maybe thats why toboein left
Page 7: you mumble, maybe she was tired about how you treat people and look at them as if they were all dummies or shit you have to clean on your sidewalk. and so did Fvqu and probably many other staff i didnt know or dont remember. From all those people,
Page 8: (tehsabbingslayer,Chozo4, Creepy, Toboein, Fvqu, all exadiawind players and me are telling you a big 
''Fuck you asshole'' and sincerly mean it. you would definitively know what it like to take something in the ass. so yeah, for your future experiences,
Page 9: stop treating your staff like shit, stop behing homophobic and try to know your server better, you stopped interacting with players and thats what will kill this place, your attitude... this book will be send to all presently connected players and will be
Page 10: market if some need it. i hope you folks realize and for the last time, Fuck you.

Page 0: A couple going on vacation but his wife was on a buisness trip so he went to the destination first and his wife would meet him the next day. 

*********

When he reached the hotel, he decided to send his wife a quick email.
Page 1: Unfortunately, when  typing her adress, he mistyped a letter and his note was directed instead to an elderly preacher's wife whose husband passed away only the day before.

**********

When the grieving widow checked her email, she took one look at the 
Page 2: monitor, let out a peircing scream, and fell to the floor in a dead faint.

At the sound, her family rushed into the room and saw this note on the screen:

Page 0: I recently have moved into a strange house...

I decided to move in because the architechture is incredible!

It is said to have been made in the 1800s...

But i always hear groans and te crattling of bones 
Page 1: below.

I would think there would be a basement in this house.

But the owner didnt mention that...

Strange indeed.

~*~

Entry II
Page 2: I have decided to actually number my entries from now on.

And i figured something out.

Straight to the point with that one.

At the entrance on the house, there are two tables. 
Page 3: And under?

Two chests.

I reached them and found a journal of the last man to own this house.

It was over in the 90s.

I was terrified. 

The mans name was
Page 4: William.

It was about the basement. My assumptions were correct.

Apparently the super natural lives there.

Zombies and skeletons.

Even though that explains the crattilng 
Page 5: of bones and the groans and croaks, i cant wrap my head around it.

§0---------------------§0
§0    I just met this world they call minecraft. I decided to log my whole life into this journal. Every memory or event that happens to me will go in here day by day.§0
§0
§0   Today the most wonderful
Page 2: thing happend. I was mining and I found some diamonds! I think I might use them to make a pickaxe so I can start constructing my house.  I want an old style house with a big roof. §0
§0
§0   It is starting to get lonley in this world 
Page 3: I wish I could find a companion.§0
§0
§0 Wow! I was walking home from my mine and I ran into a wolf. I used some bones to tame him, I guess now I won't be so lonley.. I think I will name is Ralph. Yea, me and Ralph sounds good.
Page 4:               Day 2§0
§0----------------------    Today me and ralph went to the pond. We sat there and fished for hours upon hours. I am starting to get better at this thing they call "life". One day I think I could actually do something.§0
§0Meh. Lets just 
Page 5: build for now.§0
§0
§0   I just started the construction of my house. It is a very lonley sad looking house. It seems to have nothing to bring in life. I need shelter so I guess I will have to live with my terrible building skills.
Page 6: I wish I could be like the other people. For some reason I seem to be an outcast in the minecraft community. I don't get it yet, maybe it just takes time. 
Page 7:                Day 3§0
§0----------------------§0
§0   I havn't been on this world very long. But it seems like forever with no friends. I feel lonley again, I have thoughts of quitting but I just don't. I have a feeling something will happen to me. Something bad
Page 8: later but good now. I feel like it will be the biggest adventure of my life. But who am I to think that. I am just another square.§0
§0
§0    I finally touched up my house a little bit. It still looks dark and lonley but I added some flowers to make it look 
Page 9: nicer. Just in case one day I happen to run into another person on this forsaken Earth.§0
§0
§0            Day 4§0
§0---------------------        I decided to ditch the old house and move by a pond. I really wanted to try and feel better. I figured the water could
Page 10: help my depression. Plus me and Ralph love to fish together.§0
§0
§0   For some reason Ralph seems like fishing is a bore. I am starting to get worried because he usually has a blast out here. He runs in the water and gets his long white hair wet
Page 11: and then shakes it off. I find it cute. I wonder if he is sick at all. I wouldn't know. I am just an idiot.§0
§0
§0              Day 5§0
§0----------------------     This very goreous girl joined my world! I am filled with happiness, I have never been this 
Page 12: happy ever in my life! I don't know how to explain the over welming love I have for this person. For some reason It makes me beleive in love at first site! I would try to talk to her but I doubt she would even find me remotely attractive, Im a loner.
Page 13:              Day 6§0
§0----------------------     I finally spoke to her, she seemed like a very nice person. I really like her, I hope someday we can be together in the same house and share the same love for things. The thing I find most attractive about her
Page 14: is her long blonde curly hair with her baby blue eyes. I can't explain it, she reminds me of the brightest diamond and the hottest torch. §0
§0
§0   I just showed her Ralph. I think she really likes him, this will give me a chance to hang out with her and 
Page 15: finally not be sad.§0
§0
§0              Day 7§0
§0----------------------      I finally worked up the nerve to speak a word to her. She said my nervousness was cute. This made me feel good inside. I hope I can capture this feeling forever!
Page 16:     I asked her if she wanted to come over and we can have a picnic under the stars. I am still waiting for a reply, I think she will say yes, but you never know.§0
§0
§0   Two whole hours later which felt like years she finally received my letter.
Page 17:     Yes, I had to send her a letter even though she lives across the street. I was too nervous she would turn me down and I would ruin everything.§0
§0
§0             Day 8§0
§0----------------------   Wr finally went on our first date! I am so happy!
Page 18: I am so in love, she said that she really likes me and she is thinking of marriage. This is so good for, I can finally be a normal "square" in this society of Minecraft.§0
§0
§0               Day 9§0
§0----------------------       Today is a bad day, Ralph has died
Page 19: my first companion of this brutal world. My sadness overwelms me, even though I am happy I am sad. Can anyone explain this!!§0
§0
§0   I miss Ralph so much! I just want to go fishing with him again. I want to see him wave the water off his fur. Ohhhh I miss him
Page 20: this is terrible! I hope you guys reading this in the future can understand my grief.§0
§0
§0   My future wife April is a wise lady, she tells me that everything has a purpose and I will soon find out why he died. I just hope that is soon.
Page 21:               Day 10§0
§0----------------------     Today is our marriage, even though I was just sad I feel nothing now. All I feel is love and passion for my wife April. I hope we can live in our newly  bought mansion by the lake. I think I can move on with
Page 22: my life. I am starting to think I can be happy in life, it seemed like I was always sad. Now I feel happiness.§0
§0
§0   I just held my first sword, I never used to fight mobs. I just ran and ran to shelter, yes you could say I was a weak person but
Page 23: I was afraid of the zombie and the creepers. The things that scare me the most are the skeletons. They are so accurate with their stupid bows and arrows. I started to learn how to use sword because I need to protect my lovely wife. Her life means
Page 24: everything.§0
§0
§0                Day 11§0
§0----------------------     I am panicing right now, I heard recent news of a zombie invasion. They have tooken over all the cities around us! I am scared for my life and everyone I love.
Page 25: my one focus right now is protecting my wife. She is the world and I couldn't live without her. §0
§0
§0   There is no keeping tracks of the days anymore. We have sat in this house closet  for I don't know how many days. I don't have the
Page 26: mental copacity to keep track of the days right now. I am going insane! The constant threat of zombies around our house. I am starting to think out defenses are getting weak. This house was built to live in not to withhold a zombie invasion!
Page 27:    We are both scared, My wife is shaking in my arms, I have no idea what to do. I can't fight the zombies there is more than 1,000 outside, they would just take my life and love from my wife.§0
§0
§0    I think it has been 9-10 hours since my last journal 
Page 28: entry. I don't know what day it is, all I know is we are going to die. I hope we can die in each others arms so death can come get us together.§0
§0
§0THERE IN THERE IN I CAN'T DO ANYTHING APRIL APRIL! SHE IS BEING DRAGGED
Page 29: THE ZOMBIES HAVE HER. I AM SORRY MY LOVE. I AM HIDING IN A CLOSET SCARED FOR MY LIFE. I WILL COME FOR YOU!§0
§0
§0   She has been gone, it feels like weeks, months or years! I don't know! All I know is I am coming for her.
Page 30:    I started training today. I am training to be a master at fighting these horrible beast. They will pay for what they did. None of them will live, all will die at the end of my sword. Their blood will spill everywhere. Their lives is the payment
Page 31: for taking my love.§0

§0    I have been training for what feels like 10 days straight. I complete excercises like swinging my sword and kicking hay bails. I am gaining strength, I havn't ate all day I am running of pure adrenaline.
Page 32:    I am starting my journey, I will find my love, I will kill every beast that walks in my way. THIS DAY MARKS A CHANGE IN THE WORLD.§0
§0
§0   She was right, I have a purpose and I have found it. To save her.
Page 33:    I finally have stepped outside the doors. I will not be writing for awhile, I will be slaying and cutting the heads off these beast.§0
§0
§0  I managed to find a hiding spot to sleep tonight. I am in a tree, a birch tree to be exact. This feels like a safe 
Page 34: place to rest. No hiding only rest, I will wake up as early as possible find some food to ration and be on my way.§0
§0
§0   I am stuck on a roof surrounded by zombies. There is no way I can survive. I have to stay here until the zombies think I am gone.
Page 35:     It is the middle of the night, I just had the wildest dream ever. April came to me in my dream and spoke to me. All she said was a riddle. "A place to chase, and have a happy face". §0
§0
§0   THAT'S IT! I KNOW THE ANSWER TO THE RIDDLE!
Page 36: I used to take Ralph to the park and chase him. Playing with made me smile. She is hinting for me to come to the park. I know it! She is there! Oh thank you god! THANK YOU!§0
§0
§0  It is an hour walk to park, I set out at night so I could try and sneak past 
Page 37: the beast. I grabbed one torch to help guide me through the night.§0
§0
§0    UH OH! I have made a mistake I am trapped in a bathroom being swarmed by zombies. I cannot do anything. Please god help me! HELP! 
Page 38:     My eyes went black, all I saw was green faces and a brutal world. I saw the light, someone spoke to me, someone I didn't know. They said " You can do it ". After that I felt a pull, almost like being pulled back down to earth. I woke up and jolted! I
Page 39: somehow was alive and ok. Maybe it was a dream, just maybe. I continued to the park, it was still pitch black and I had lost my torch for the night. I was working of pure instinct. I finally made it. There she WAS APRIL WAS THERE!§0
§0I AM FILL WITH JOY!
Page 40:    I ran up to her, I tried to hug her and say " I love you ". But when she turned I saw her real form. They had turned her. She was one with the beast. I didn't know what to do. I knew I had to the right thing. My love and I...........
Page 41:     I kneeled her down and confessed my love.§0
§0
§0Raised my sword§0
§0
§0And Cutt her head off.§0
§0
§0It was the end§0
§0
§0Nothing§0
§0
§0Just nothing.
Page 42:   I sat there, saw the beast coming. I held my love in my arms, sat there and just thought about our lives.§0
§0
§0   Now I am sitting here in my old house. Writing the rest of this diary.§0
§0
§0I want to end this
Page 43: I want you guys to know what happens to me and to the world.§0
§0
§0The zombie invasion has gotten worse. I have decided that I will do the best thing for me and the world.

Page 4:      Introduction§0
§0=================== Welcome to potion brewing! If you're new, keep in mind that you need a brewing stand, glass bottles filled with water, and many ingredients, which vary depending on what type of potion you may want to create.
Page 5:      Introduction§0
§0=================== Every brewing stand has the capability to hold at maximum three bottles at a time, meaning you can make 3 potions for every single ingredient you add. Keep this in mind!
Page 6:   Base Ingredients§0
§0=================== These ingredients start all potions.§0
§0------------------- ?Nether Wart§0
§0?Glowstone Dust§0
§0?Redstone§0
§0?Fermented Spider Eye [Adding these to a water bottle will create a base potion. see page 11]

Page 9:   Effect Corruption§0
§0=================== Fermented Spider Eyes will change a potion's base effect, often reversing it or producing a negative potion. A "corrupted" potion usually does the opposite of the original potion.
Page 10:       Base Potions§0
§0=================== Base potions, much like base ingredients, are the basis of all potions. These are the potions created by simply a watter bottle and a base ingredient together.

	Author: Brooke356
	Type: Written

Page 0:    **The Admin**
   **By Machiavelli**
   **Brooke356**
Page 1: Chapter 1: 
Of Power and Which it is Acquired
~~
All servers are either republics or tyrannies. Republics are not to be dealt with. By strength or fortune, one can acquire a tyranny.
Page 2: Chapter 2:
Hereditary Principalities
~
It is easier to govern a hereditary than a new principality. The natural admin only has to keep these institutions intact and adapt to them.
Page 3: Chapter 3:
Of Attaining Power
~
In a principality, one attains power by either fortune or blood line. 
Page 4: Chapter 4:
Of Maintaining Power
~~
If an admin attains his power by choice of commoners, he has more difficulty maintaining it and must please the citizens that voted for him. 
Page 5: Chapter 5:
Of City States
~
An admin governs his city-states. Republics are the hardest to govern. They must either be looted and disposed of or lived in to keep control.
Page 6: Chapter 6:
How the strength of all admins should be measured
~
Although an admin should maintain a strong army, he must also work on his defenses.
Page 7: Author's Note:
"The Admin" is an abriged version of the famous historical political handbook entitled "The Prince" by ancient Italian Niccolo Machiavelli. He writes on how to attain and maintain power, wage war, and govern city-states. In this version, 
Page 8: the author writes a handbook for powers of an admin; how to attain and maintain power, and how to 'govern' a server.

Page 9: (also the prince is really hard to read and makes 0 sense which is why basically none of this makes sense I'm not stupid okay)

§0It has been a long time since I wrote.  I went today to a far away land full of tall creatues.  They lives upon an island that floated in nothingness, and there I found her, the dragon queen
Page 4: We fought a fearsome fight but in the end I prevailed.  Upon slaying the beast, I found her egg, alone and unattended.  I felt remorse for what I'd done and decided to take it home and hatch it.§0

Page 5: I have chosen to spend more time with this handsome man.  He has to power to breathe water, and has bestowed it on me.  We enjoy strolls on the ocean floor
Page 6: In exchange I have bestowed on him a bow, bound to his soul through are bond.  It shall be in his hand forever
Page 7: I have a soulbound bow myself, and with it I slew another dragon.  The battle was swift.  I used my new found knowledge to bestow new powers within books, but none were of great note.§0

Page 9: 1/30/16§0
§0
§0It's a new year, with new perks for both myself and the boy.  It seems we have gained godlike powers in this strange world.  We can shape the land with our will and make objects appear and vanish.  We continue to spend time together,

§0Much time has passed, and we have spent it together.  Through the better part of 5 years he has accompanied me on my journey.  We continue to adventure, now slaying and summoning dragons with a thought.
Page 12: We have erected a statue of us so that everybody may know of our lives and adventures here.  There is trouble on the horizon however.  Rumor has it the entire world will be swallowed soon to be made anew.  I look forward to this day, as it will mark a

Page 1:  Toward the end of the 1940s, Soviet researchers sealed five prison inmates in an airtight chamber and dosed them with an experimental stimulant gas to test the effects of prolonged sleep deprivation. 
Page 2: Their behavior was observed via two-way mirrors and their conversations monitored electronically. They had been promised their freedom if they could go entirely without sleep for 30 days.
Page 3: The first few days of the experiment passed uneventfully. By the fifth day, however, the subjects began showing signs of stress and were overheard bemoaning their circumstances. 
Page 4: hey stopped conversing with their fellow inmates, choosing instead to whisper compromising information about one another into the microphones, apparently in an effort to win the favor of the researchers. 
Page 5: Paranoia set §0in.On§0 the ninth day the screaming began. First one subject, then another, was observed running around the chamber screaming at the top of his lungs for hours on end. 
Page 6: Equally disconcerting was the reaction of the quieter subjects, who began ripping apart the books they'd been given to read, smearing the pages with feces, and plastering them over the mirrored windows so their actions could no longer be observed.
Page 7: Just as suddenly, the screaming stopped. The subjects ceased communicating altogether. Three long days passed without a sound from inside the §0chamber.Fearing§0 the worst, the researchers addressed the subjects via the intercom.
Page 8: We are opening the chamber to test the microphones," they said. "Step away from the door and lie flat on the floor or you will be shot. Compliance will earn one of you your immediate freedom."A voice from inside answered, We no longer want to be freed."
Page 9: Two more days passed without contact of any kind as the scientists debated what to do next. Finally, they decided to terminate the experiment.
Page 10: At midnight on the fifteenth day the stimulant gas was flushed from the chamber and replaced with fresh air in preparation for the subjects' release.
Page 11: Far from being pleased at the prospect of leaving the chamber, the subjects began screaming as if in fear for their §0lives.They§0 begged to have the gas turned back on. Instead,the researchers unsealed the door to the
Page 12: chamber and sent armed soldiers inside to retrieve them. Nothing could have prepared them for the carnage they witnessed upon entering. One subject was found dead, lying face-down in sixinches of bloody water. Chunks of his
Page 13: flesh had been torn off and stuffed into the floor drain. All of the test subjects were found to have been severely mutilated, in fact. What's worse, the wounds appeared to be self-inflicted.
Page 14: They had ripped open their own abdomens and disemboweled themselves with their bare hands. Some had even eaten their own flesh. The four who were still alive seemed terrified of falling asleep and refused to leave the chamber, again pleading
Page 15: with the researchers to turn the gas back on. When the soldiers attempted to remove the inmates by force, they fought back so ferociously they couldn't believe their eyes. One suffered a ruptured spleen and lost so much blood 
Page 16: there was literally nothing left for his heart to pump, yet continued flailing for a full three minutes until his lifeless body collapsed. The remaining subjects were restrained and transported to a medical facility for treatment. 
Page 17: The first to be operated on fought so furiously against being anesthetized that he tore muscles and broke bones during the struggle. As soon as the anesthetic took effect his heart stopped and he died. The rest underwent surgery without sedation.
Page 18: Far from feeling any pain, however, they laughed hysterically on the operating table -- so hysterically that the doctors, perhaps fearing for their own sanity, administered a paralytic agent to immobilize them. After surgery the survivors were asked why 
Page 19: they had mutilated themselves, and why they so desperately wanted to go back on the stimulant gas. Each, in turn, gave the same answer: "I must remain awake."The researchers considered euthanizing them to obliterate every trace of the failed 
Page 20: experiment, but were overruled by their commanding officer, who ordered that it be resumed immediately, with three of the researchers joining the inmates in the sealed chamber. Horrified at the prospect, 
Page 21: the chief researcher pulled out a pistol and shot the commanding officer point blank. He then turned and shot one of the two surviving subjects. Pointing his gun at the last one left alive, he asked, What are you? I must know!"
Page 22: "Have you forgotten so easily?" the subject said, smiling. We are you. We are the madness that lurks within you all, begging to be free at every moment in your deepest animal mind. We are what you hide from in your beds every night.
Page 23: We are what you sedate into silence and paralysis when you go to the nocturnal haven where we cannot tread."
Page 24: The researcher fired a bullet into his heart. The EEG monitor flatlined as the subject murmured these last words: "§0So...nearly...free."§0

18? Potion of Fire Res. 19? Potion of Regen.
20? Potion of Strength

Page 3:  TABLE OF CONTENTS
=================== 24? Potion of Leaping
25? Negative Potions
26? Potion of Poision
27? Potion of Weakness 28? 
Page 4:      Introduction
=================== Welcome to potion brewing! If you're new, keep in mind that you need a brewing stand, glass bottles filled with water, and many ingredients, which vary depending on what type of potion you may want to create.
Page 5:      Introduction
=================== Every brewing stand has the capability to hold at maximum three bottles at a time, meaning you can make 3 potions for every single ingredient you add. Keep this in mind!
Page 6:   Base Ingredients
=================== These ingredients start all potions.
------------------- ?Nether Wart
?Glowstone Dust
?Redstone
?Fermented Spider Eye [Adding these to a water bottle will create a base potion. see page 11]
Page 7: Secondary Ingredients =================== ?Magma Creme
?Sugar
?Glistering Melon
?Spider Eye
?Ghast Tear
?Blaze Powder
?Fermented Spider Eye

=================== Add these to a potion to alter their effects. -------------------?Redstone
[Increases duration]
?Glowstone Dust
[Increases potency]
?Gunpowder
[Turns into a splash]
?Fermented Spider Eye
[See next page]
Page 9:   Effect Corruption
=================== Fermented Spider Eyes will change a potion's base effect, often reversing it or producing a negative potion. A "corrupted" potion usually does the opposite of the original potion.
Page 10:       Base Potions
=================== Base potions, much like base ingredients, are the basis of all potions. These are the potions created by simply a watter bottle and a base ingredient together.

Page 1: you the Mayor of the town. The Albion signs have been removed and law books burned. You may do what you wish as far as how to take care of your new town. I will  of course have to come visit you! I have also left my home and remaining possessions with you
Page 2: There is a sign pointing to a secret door that leads to a basement where you are free to use it or not. 

Hope to see you soon Mayor!

	Title: The Name Steve
	Author: jjp1234
	Type: Written

Page 0: Don't ask me what I'm doing here, because I don't know. One day, I woke up in the middle of a forest, covered in snow, devoid of all memory and sense of identity. Why? I have no clue. It almost doesn't matter. I spent the first couple of hours calling for
Page 1: help, wandering around hoping I'd fine someone nearby. After a while, I came to the reluctant conclusion that I was well and truly isolated: no sounds of human voices, no hum of tires on distant roadways; nothing but the trill of far off birds and
Page 2: rustling branches in the wind. There might have been a cow nearby from all the mooing, but I couldn't find it.§0
§0I might not have know who I am, or why I woke up in this snowy forest, but that didn't mean I was going to sit down and let depression take me
Page 3: along with the wolves. I needed a plan of action, need to find a way to survive. But first, a man needs to know himself before he can trust himself, and because my old name was lost to my departed memory. I have decided to call myself Steve. Its a good 
Page 4: name.I spent some time searching the area, looking for anything that might be useful to me. Tools and weapons would be my first priority--don't ask me how I knew, but I could tell the forest would be dangerous at night, I don't know why. There
Page 5: wasn't much, not even a single fallen branch on the ground, just smooth snow and straight pine trees. i tried to grab hold of a few rocks peeking up from the soil,but they were firmly stuck. I'd need something to pry them free, or maybe break them away. I
Page 6: spotted a tree nearby and went to it, running my hands over the dark brown bark. It was a good tree.. strong and healthy.§0
§0
§0So I punched it.§0
§0
§0Pulp and bark flew as my hard fists broke chunk after chunk.
Page 7:  I gritted my teeth against the jarring in my arms and kept going until the whole thing broke through and crashed to the §0ground.Chest§0 heaving from the exertion, I gathered the wood and sat down, examining the pieces. I broke some of the longer chunks into
Page 8: thick sticks, then stabbed on of them into piece of wood shaped like a blade.§0
§0I grinned as I hefted the wooden axe I'd made, then swung it around experimentally. It felt good. I used the axe to fell several more tress until I had enough wood to make all
Page 9: the tools I needed: a shovel, sword and a pickaxe--the latter of which I used to break those stubborn stone from the ground. I stowed the rocks away for later use and strapped the tools to my back. I kept the sword out though, the feeling of danger in the
Page 10: woods tickling the back of my mind. Thus armed, I set off in search of food and shelter.I won't bore you with the details of my struggle against starvation and §0wolves.Suffice§0 it to say, it was a struggle. I fought, bled and conquered. I stumbled over
Page 11: hills and down into water-filled valleys, climbing trees to see the path ahead. I slew cows and ate their flesh to stay alive.I fell off cliffs and broke bones, spending days waiting for them to heal. I briefly marveled at how quickly the wounds mended,
Page 12: but wasted no time in pressing on once they did. At night times, I was attacked by monsters, proving my intuition about the forest to be correct. I hid from the darkness, lighting the small mud huts I'd built along the way with torches until the sim rose
Page 13: once again. I never knew why the world I'd woken up in was filled with skeletons and zombies, but it didn't really matter, I bashed their heads in with stone swords nonetheless. There were more questions to be had than answers, and I knew I would never
Page 14: know half of them.§0
§0
§0I had to SURVIVE!§0
§0
§0Weeks later, exhausted, clothes ripped and torn, blood from numerous cuts on my legs trailing into my socks, I finally found mountains. Majestic. I climbed them each, looking for the ideal spot to build a home
Page 15: far away from the oprressive trees and monster-filled shadows of the forest.I avoided the caves beneath those mountains, fearful of skeletons and massive spiders.I knew I would have to venture inside them eventually, but no then. I finally found a flat
Page 16: topped peak that overlooked the forests to the eats, and the ocean to the west. From its heights, I would be able to see the while land, and defend my homestead from intruders.§0
§0
§0It was good.
Page 17: That was a few months ago. I've since become used to this way of life, in this strange land. The name of Steve fits me like a glove, and I am the master of my modest stone home. I've raised cattle, planted wheat, and baked bread. I've explored those
Page 18: mysterious caved and returned the victor,bringing home coal for fires, iron for tools and armor, precious gold and even a priceless diamond. I am king of all I see, master of this forsaken land And then yesterday, my house blew up.... The building in

Page 0: My request for a position on the city council: After being a part of this city for the past several weeks and building both the second and fourth tallest buildings within the city, I really feel that it would benefit me and some other residents within the
Page 1: city to know how the government election process works, and for me to be able to hold some sort of city council position, whether high or low. I'm sorry I had to deliver this message by this unusual means, but I didn't see any sort of dropbox in the

Page 0: Creative. A server like any other, but with an era like no other. The Desert era. The desert was a group based on becoming the top group of mutts, a new of it's time. But never fully done, they came close but order was lost, destroying the group 2 times. 
Page 1: The Desert's leader CandyServal was a man who never had finished his ideas. He lost many friends he new, and found a few, never keeping them, always losing them in the end. The Desert's origins where simply just him creating a group with an HQ but that is
Page 2: only the start. After he finished he recruited clan members and soon got a few. But war started when someone decided to destroy part of Candy's HQ Jenna. Jenna was the leader of the XX as a less powerful ignorant group of almost everything. Every 
Page 3: creative group was burdened with the lack of iformation. After Jenna was banned from the plot, she created her own sub group, the same for the lettuce. After they all finished leaving, the desert era turned from 1 faction into 3. After that, Candy was
Page 4: rambling on survival about his group, concering an NFU official the leader of Nile Perch, Yuugo. Yuugo didn't know of creative groups, and soon the NFU and UFN allied with Candy Serval. Most help came from Nile Perch and some from The NFR. After this a
Page 5: period of inovation for the Desert began, the creative groups where given rockets, engines, and auto fire weapons. However the rockets where siezed by the XX and after they where Taken they where pirated, and 2 members where lost, with thier group's name

§0yes I'm not joking. Anway Candy was banned soon for rude jokes, and the group collapsed for the first time, for the second§0
§0he was unbanned, and banned for plotting a grief, which was normal for him. He was banned from creative, and

§0Anvil town was an old civilzation based off of a spawn area, normal for towns, anvil town was created above water and only§0
§0operated from nearby recoures expanding simply for it's own needs, eventually going under conecting with under
Page 1: the town. Soon a new was born, an era for the town they brought in players, casuing grief and anarchy. A beloved player of the town Pizzahut67 was banned throwing the town's polticial power into an anarchy, and the town collapsed. The old players resorted
Page 2: to leaving and went to a new place, an island, and that's where the civilzation ended and created a new a home that eventually died. Why? because of time, people left things die. Many things on mutts die, just like that.

§0I'm writing these journal stuff 'cause if i ever stop playing on this server, i wanna tell people about my expierience. My name's ZilverDragon aaaand I live in this region with my irl friend, FlamerGamer_2121. We're the only ones who live
Page 1: in this region. I used to play survival like, a year ago, but then I stopped. Now I'm back playing. I remember all the people that used to live in this neighborhood. Now it's empty. I kinda like it empty because I get to raid people's farms. I also have 
Page 2: creative friends, but I haven't seen them in a long time. My username was CateThe§0
§0Great808 back then, but i changed it. I remember PandaCait, Weeping_dalek(she's still on I think) Dooby2013, btrtank, ilovezombi205, and A LOT more. My house is this 
Page 3: treehouse along with the lake behind it and the island above it. Flamer's house is down the hill made out of wood and cobblestone. It looks like a villager's house. We both love our town and be both raid people's farms. We've met a few people so far. Ima 
Page 4: tell you more about when I first discovered Muttsworld. When I first came, I came for the creative server mostly. Then I moved to survival. It just started raining in the region. It rains a lot here. When I was on survival, I had the smallest shed full of
Page 5: random stuff. Then someone made a terrible treehouse so i decided to move into that. That treehouse was not the one I have now. I got a horse and stuff. Lately, I've been killed by Infernals and jumping off my island. It's fun tho. I like gouing to other 
Page 6: people's houses. I love my town 'cause I love how everything looks apocalyptic-e. It's fun running around in it. I'm thinking of repairing everything. For some reasons my cows keep dissappearing. Now I decided I'd tear down my house and build a new 
Page 7: treehouse (the one I have now) I also decided to put an island in the sky because I looooooooove fantasy. Flamer and I love jumping off of it into water. She has died more than me while jumping off. I've also took the care to repair some of the
Page 8: other abodoned house's farms just for fun. Sure other regions are far more fancier than ours, but I don't really mind. I think that's just about wraps it up for now. Sorry that this entry was soooo long. I just wanted to keep you up with all that's been 
Page 9: going on. Oh great, now it's thundering. I'll be doing these entries everytime I log on to survival (if i don't forget) See ya in the future! (I don't like good byes 'cause it makes me feel like i'm never gonna see someone again)§0

Page 10: October 4, 2015§0
§0Nothing much has changed since yesterday. My friend showed me his new house which is a ship. I died once from falling off the island. I also discovered these GIANT houses on the other side of the forest. They didn't have any good loot tho.
Page 11: I almost got in trouble 'cause I put a sign that said I was gonna eat somebody and they took it seriously. Lol. I almost drowned too. I think that's pretty much it. See ya for now!§0

Page 12: October 17, 2015§0
§0Sorry I haven't been on. End of quarter projects are hard. It's like, 10:30 in the morning. Pretty normal when I logged on. I had to fix my cobblestone generator 'cause Flame broke it. Then chickens started spawning whereever
Page 13: I stood. One got caught in a wall and suffocated. They also have this AutoSort thing that's new, and it's really helpful. It just sorts your inventory and chests. I'll keep you updated during the day hopefully. Flame's watching a movie, so I have to wait 
Page 14: for her to finish it. Ok so it's about 8:00pm now, and today was pretty good. We hung out with Ap for a while. We encased Flame while she was afk, and she got REALLY mad. Ap and I are building my own ship next to his and his other friend's. Mine is oak. 
Page 15: That's about pretty much it for today. See ya soon!§0
§0-ZilverDragon
Page 16: October 18, 2015§0
§0Ok so it turns out that the oak ship I was building with Ap was for IvlyHoon (I think that's his name) lol. That's cruel. Flame died jumping off the sail again. Not a suprise. I was playing with jonathan_budder for a while. He's nice.
Page 17: He's also rich just like everyone else on this server except for Flame and I. Nothing else new. See ya next time!§0
§0-ZilverDragon
Page 18: October 20, 2015§0
§0Ok so I've decided to build a second house not near any other civilization, because I like having seceret houses and rooms like that, ya know? I was originally going to set it up at boat7. There was already an old house there, but I 
Page 19: tore it down. There was a bunch of floating glass things and a minecart ride to a "town." I built my house there, but I didn't like that the clouds floated inside the house 'cause I guess boat7 is on a mountain. I then tore down the house and moved to
Page 20: pumpkin9. I actually am moving all my stuff to pumpkin9, but I'm still pretending to live in stream3. I think I'm still going to keep my pets there. It's pretty nice here, and you get a nice view of the snowy landscape. I just finished it and now i'm 
Page 21: moving all my stuff to the new house. That's about it for today. See ya!§0
§0-ZilverDragon
Page 22: October 24, 2015§0
§0Ok so this entry is going to be about yesterday. Yesterday was Trunk or Treat at my school, but I didn't go, and I'm glad I didn't. Flame and I moved here, and I built her a house. After we did that, we went to Ap's boat. We think he's a 
Page 23: showoff because he just puts ore blocks unprotected in the middle of the boat. We "borrowed" some of his enchanted stuff and replaced them with other poorly enchanted stuff. Flame also took his Freddy head and left a sign. Flame and I then went on an
Page 24: expedition. We visited some regions and raided abandoned houses. They actually got some pretty good loot. Then she had to go =(. See ya later!§0
§0Ok so this is for today. It's pretty normal. Flame and I raided a couple regions again. We helped Tahoe4
Page 25: build a house. We also made a friend. His name is Joe something. He wants to build his own house near ours and we were like,"ehhh. Let us think." he gets mad easly. Nothing new really. See Ya!§0
§0-ZilverDragon
Page 26: October 27, 2015§0
§0Ok so today Flame and I found out that Ap locked the chests with enchanted stuff. He found out that we switched stuff from the chests. Everything was normal as usual. I started puting a bunch of animals in my basement, and I made a well. 
Page 27: I also started making an automatic chicken farm just for eggs 'cause ima Pokemon master. That's about it. Pretty boring i know. See ya!§0
§0-ZilverDragon
Page 28: October 30, 2015§0
§0Ok so today is Friday, but I have no school so, yay! I made theses really cool enchanted bow and swords. They give poison and wither effect. I improved my farm so the water wouldn't freeze all the time now too. I added carrots, potatoes, 
Page 29: and more sugarcane. Everything is normal like always. I went to Ap's and got some levels for enchantments. I also got A LOT of wood and xp 'cause of my jobs, and I encounters 2 witches so far. I moved the cobblestone generator from my old house to my new 
Page 30: house, and I did a little trading. Oh yeah, I also found this HUGE cave system and was able to get A LOT of iron and coal. I also had to fight an enderman underground. Ok so there was a Halloween skin comp and I didn't win T_T. So I vowed to go on a 
Page 31: murderous rampage. xD. Jk (maybe) that's about it for now! See ya!§0
§0-ZilverDragon
Page 32: December 7, 2015§0
§0  OMG I'M SO SO SOOOOOOOO SORRY. I'VE BEEN ON CREATIVE FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME. I've been playing on creative mostly now 'cause I've reunited with some friends, and I've gotten into RPs again. Lately, a lot has happned (kinda). I've§0

Page 33: constructed a hot air balloon behind my house. I found HUGE FARMS AND MANSIONS THAT HAS ALLLLLLLLLLL LE MATERIALS. So, I've marked them so I can go back to them. I've made some more creative friends, and Flame and I have constructed a beacon! I've also 
Page 34: constructed two boats for Flame and I. Mine's name is Shirubahato which means "Silver Heart" in Japanese. Flame's ship is named "Flammeum Fast" which means Flaming Fast in Latin. Also, Flame changed her name from FlamPlaysMC to FlamerPlaysMC. Lol. She 
Page 35: didn't mess up this time. That pretty much sums it up. I'll write later (if I remember)§0

Page 37: The members are: Me, SammehMalfoy, omgdaniella, tinyunicorn, and Ezhun. We built this town, and I'm moving my stuff into this house. Daniella and Unicorn are living with me too. I also killed two infernals two days ago and got a Hunger Charm and Bunny

Page 41: May 4, 2016§0
§0   OK so it has been a waaayyyyyyy long time since I've did this. Couple notes. Sam, Daniella, Kaleyah, Ez, and Smarns haven't been on anymore so I'm basically taking over the town. ahahah. I've remodeled the HQ again along with our town sign.
Page 42: A couple months before Ez and I exploded Mini's stupid statue, and that made Ez get banned but not me LOL. But now it's back. I hate it so much. I made another floating island and my house is grassyland. I added a tiny wheat farm on the side of my house
Page 43: to make some more money. I also entered the elytra race BUT I GOT SECOND I AM NOT LIVING UP TO MY EXPECTATIONS I'M SO SAD. Also, my irl friend FourHeartz was introduced to this server by me! She's been on creative tho. I dunno if she wants to come onto
Page 44: survival. Also, I flooded Ez's house as an April Fools prank, but he hasn't been unbanned yet. Ap came back a couple weeks ago but he hasn't been on again. I dunno anything about Codehh sooooo... I also changed mah skin to have my actual hair color except
Page 45: longer. I gotta maskkk. I also changed my username back to ZilverDragon. I didn't really like KismetDragon. I think that's all I can't update on for now. See ya!§0

	Title: The Guardian Kin
	Author: BradTheEpic1
	Type: Written

Page 0: The first book of the BradTheEpic book series.§0
§0
§0"The Guardian King"
Page 1: The boat creaked a dangerous creak before tilting to the other side. The waves crashed off the hull. "Man overboard!" was screamed from one end of the ship. Everyone ran to see who had fallen but bubbles in the water were all that was seen. All the men
Page 2: removed their hats in sorrow and sadness when suddenly a rumbling sound was heard from below. Everyone looked around scared as to what was happening. The water below suddenly rippled and splashed: The man who had just falled overboard was floating out of 
Page 3: the water and into the air! Little purple particles floated off of him.§0
§0"It's a miracle!" He screamed with joy as he flew higher and higher.§0
§0"um... I want down now.."§0
§0He moaned, about 10 blocks in the air. "HELP!!!"§0
§0The man stopped floating.
Page 4: He suddenly fell down and landed on the deck of the boat with a cracking sound, sending him to half a heart.§0
§0"GET THIS MAN A HEALTH POTION, STAT!" Shouted the captain, pushing him into the cabin.§0
§0"What on earth happened there?" He asked the men.
Page 5: They shrugged.§0
§0
§0Another ripple and suddenly a grass block floated out from the water.§0
§0"Huh?" "What the-"§0
§0"ummm..."§0
§0Everyone was confused.§0
§0Another ripple, and this time a sand block.§0
§0"Someone is trolling us.." a sailor said.
Page 6: The captain froze with fear.§0
§0"I read about this once... This isnt a troll..."§0
§0he didnt move.§0
§0"Uhh, captain, What is it then?" Asked a sailor.§0
§0"Its... Its...."§0
§0He was cut off by loads and loads of guardians flying out of the water and into the air above
Page 7: the ship.§0
§0"GUARDIANS!" He screamed. "RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!!!"§0
§0The men dived to the side avoiding the dangerous shots of the guardians. They made the weirdest sounds, sounds that no man should ever hear, no sound that man has ever heard.§0
§0There were
Page 8: hundreds of them, thousands, MILLIONS/ Arrows were flying through the air like flies, shooting down the occasional guardian. One landed on the deck and made a huge hole in the wooden planks with a crash, and one of the masts fell down, killing a sailor.
Page 9: "This is far too dangerous!" The captain said, slashing his sword at a nearby guardian. "We need to get to land and call for more help!".§0
§0The captain ran to the wheel and spun it around, sending the sailors and guardians to one side of the ship. A few of
Page 10: both fell overboard and the men that fell with guardians didn't last long after that. The captain was holding onto the wheel so tight that a guardian shot at him and he ripped it completely off the ship.§0
§0"We're gonna die here!" He screamed.
Page 11: He threw the wheel at a guardian which was lying upon a sailor, saving him.§0
§0"Thanks, cap!" The sailor shouted as he stabbed another guardian. The ship suddenly went up a huge wave and all the sailors slid to the side of the boat.§0
§0"Kill them all!" Shouted 
Page 12: the captain. He stabbed his sword through another guardian when a huge rumble was heard. Even the guardians stopped for a minute.§0
§0The entire world shook. The boat was falling apart with the force.§0
§0"Earthquake? Volcano eruption? Is this the end of the
Page 13: minecraft world as we know it?!" Screeched a sailor.§0
§0The water bubbled for a minute and suddenly out erupted the king guardian, 10 times the size of a normal one.§0
§0"Just when you thought it couldnt get worse..." mumbled the captain. "Kill it! Its the 
Page 14: source of power! Kill it and the rest die!" Shouted one of the sailors. All the men ran to the side of the ship that the king was on and started firing arrows. The king shot a deadly shot at the side of the ship and blasted a hole into it.§0
§0"We are gonna
Page 15: sink! kill it now!" Demanded the captain.§0
§0The final arrow was shot and was put right into the kings brain.§0
§0The king froze for a second before letting out an ear piercing screech. It was dead.§0
§0They had won.§0
§0The kind exploded with a great white light and 
Page 16: following it all the other guardians.§0
§0"We did it men!" Shouted the captain.§0
§0"Quick, jump overboard, grab a plank!". The boat was sinking fast. It was just then the captain got an idea. He grabbed his flare gun and shot it into the air three times. A 
Page 17: minute later, a plane flew overhead and dropped a stack of sponge blocks, which absorbed the water around and under the ship, allowing the men to stand in a large cube of dry land in the middle of the ocean.§0
§0"We did it!" They cheered.
Page 18: "Uhh.. Captain, i have a question." asked one of the sailors.§0
§0"Yes, laddy?" The captain replied.§0
§0"You had a flare gun this whole time... and you used a sword to kill the guardians?"§0
§0
§0
§0
§0
§0THE END.

      Muttsworld
         Story



by Sammich98
Page 1:    Once upon a time,
there was a beautiful princess named Sammich. She was only a beautiful princess because her skin was Princess Daisy.
  She had discovered Muttsworld after some time of single player minecraft and played for a while in solitude and 
Page 2: silence. At some point, she got a boyfriend by the name of "mrawesome12345" or something of the likes. Then, after Minecraft dating him for a while he got banned, because his "brother" griefed. She still visited his house at /spawn 4 until it was no 
Page 3: longer a command and she was too lazy to walk from there. Sometime between then and now, she got active in the chat and was very helpful to the many, many noobs of Muttsworld. It was about 5 or 6 months of playing, and she made a staff application to be 
Page 4: an ambassador. That was when only mods and admins could reply to applications and anyone could reply to ban appeals. Sammich got quite positive feedback on the app, with +0.5s and +1s.
  Then.... after a month of the application being there with
Page 5: nothing but positive reviews, she logged on to Muttsworld and a friend said something to her in chat.
"huh?" was about what her reply was.
Then, the realization sunk in. She was an ambassador.



Page 6: Skip forward to April 2013, where she didn't play Minecraft for a month or so and got demoted. She basically didn't play much for a while, until the fall of 2013, when she got re-promoted to ambassador. So then, she played Muttsworld lots and lots
Page 7: as an ambassador, until one day...

Mumblerit needed a shower, but no mods were on to handle modreqs.
"who wants to be a mod?" he had asked
A cry of "me!" was seen in diplochat.
Page 8: "lol" was all the beautiful Princess Sammich said.
"ah, sammich. perfect" was about what mumblerit had said.
So, she was a mod.
  Then, that brings us to where we are now (well, where Sammich is now as she is writing this), which is Sammich floating
Page 9: in the sky at /spawn.

	Title: The Creature
	Author: TheBatKid100

Page 0: §0      The night was young as I started the long journey home from the mineshaft. Today, like most days wasn`t so bad. I stack of iron and finally some gold meant that i could make that gold horse armour for Shelia. I was on my way home when I heard a 

Page 1: §0sound in the distant.    "FWOARP". I`ve never heard that sound before. I`ll be honest, I haven`t played minecraft for a while, especially on my favorite server, Muttsworld, but i`ve played it enough to know that that sound was pretty rare. I ignored it 
Page 2: §0and continued to trod to my house, at a faster pace though.

I was so happy when I finally got home. It was beginning to rain anyway. I put the iron and gold in seperate furnaces and ate some baked potatoes. "FWOARP"! I stopped eating and bolted to 
Page 3: §0the downstairs enchantment room where I heard the sound. "What the hell is that". I looked around and saw nothing. Nothing but some purple particles in the air.

I started to cringe. I just found out what was following me. It`s in my opinion one of the 
Page 4: §0scariest mobs in minecraft, and now it was taking residence in my own home. I went to the chest room and looked for my iron sword. I had no choice but to hunt before I became the hunted. If only I had some pumpkins.

I looked in the market listing for 
Page 5: §0anyone selling some pumpkins but there was none. This only made me more scared as I went back upstairs. I took the iron out of the furnace and made some armour. I was protected, yet the creature still had the element of suprise and fear on its side.
Page 6: §0"If only I had made the headroom for my house smaller, maybe then It wouldn`t be able to get in". I checked the bedrooms of my house, then the bathrooms. It was nowhere to be seen. I knew it was here though because I could still hear the "FWOARP" sounds.
Page 7: §0I decided to check the last place in the house. Shelia`s stable. I was hesitant at first, since Shelia`s stable was at the lowest part of the house, but I had no choice. I stepped down the stairs and opened the door. Shelia looked me directly in the eyes
Page 8: §0At least that`s what I thought, since I didn`t realize that she was actually looking behind me. I turned around and saw purple particles everywhere. The creature`s mouth opened wide as he let out a high pitched shriek. I was scared to look at it, I start
Page 9: §0swinging like crazy. I heard the sound of death so I opened my eyes with joy. Only to see the saddle item drop on the floor. The creature was nowhere to be seen.

I deduced that it left because the rain had just finished. I Made a grave in the backyard o
Page 10: §0the house and placed the saddle inside of it. To this day I am no longer scared of that Creature or any others like it. In fact, I made a vow to take it down if it was the last thing I would do.

Completely original and made on the spot. Hope you enjoyed!

Day One

It has been very hard. I have already bought all of the sand on the market to use for glass... The floor isn't even HALF DONE!
Page 1: Day Two

Still no sand on the market... And nobody has ten stacks to sell me either. I met a new guy called wario355. He was very useful...
Page 2: Day Three

This is getting interesting, i have found sand and wario355 seems to be trying to get close as if it's some kind of trap...
Page 3: Day Four

As I sit here writing this book, I realise the sand still hasn't cooked... WHAT SORCERY IS THIS!? I do think I may be going crazy...
WHAT IS HAPPENING!?
Although i haven't finished the floor yet, I do quite believe that it shall be finished...
Page 4: Day 4 (Pt. 2)

I am collecting the sand from the furnaces, I don't think i have enough... Only 6 stacks... BAH! Who am I kidding... LET'S DO THIS! Or maybe I should wait until the night is over...


Page 5: Day 4 (Pt. 3)

Now the night is over, I shall finish my castle floor! Yes, I am still on the floor... WOAH! Nearly fell today, and I may have misplaced one glass block, but that does not matter-
Page 6: Ending

-For i have finished!
(Well, at least the floor)

It is time to say farewell, look out for Vol. 2 in a few days, weeks, maybe months, if I get round to it, that is.

     How To Enchant


An Enchanting Guide by: KittyPuppy123

Page 1:      Table of Contents

3. Anvils
Page 2:   Chapter 1
         Recipes

Welcome! This book is a guide on how to enchant! First thing you're gonna need is an Enchantment Table or an Anvil. To enchant on an Anvil, you need Enchanted Books which can be found or enchanted. Books can
Page 3: be enchanted to make Enchanted Books on an Enchantment Table. To make an Enchantment Table, you need 4 Obsidian, 2 Diamonds, and 1 Book. To make an Anvil, you need 3 Iron Blocks and 4 Iron Ingots.
Page 4:    Chapter 2
         How To Enchant 
When you enchant an item, (Sword, Bow, or an Armor Piece.) put it in the slot that has a grayish picture of an Armor Piece and a Sword. Then, you need levels. Experience is dropped by mobs, except for Villagers. Every
Page 5: animal drops about the same Experience orbs. I believe Endermen or Iron Golems drop the most, not including The Ender Dragon, dropping 1200 Exp Points. Maybe even 12000, but I am unsure. Click on one of the Green Number things in a tannish rectangle, and
Page 6: it will come up with a random enchantment. Now, if you're very lucky, you may get like Sharpness IV.
Page 7:    Chapter 3
        Anvils.

As I have explained, you're gonna need Enchanted Books for Anvils. Put what you would like to enchant in the first slot, then the Enchanted Book in the second slot. In the third slot, will come out your enchanted item. 
Page 8: But, you need levels to enchant it. You can also rename your item, with a cost of about 5 levels, but it depends if the item is rare or not. The least levels to rename your item is about 5. You can also repair items by putting 2 together, but this costs
Page 9: levels too. Now, you can't mix a Diamond Pickaxe with an Iron Pickaxe. For example, your Diamond Pickaxe is almost about to break. You try to mix it with a Wooden Pickaxe, that won't work. Say if your Golden Helmet is about to die. Mix it with another
Page 10: Golden Helmet, to repair it.

Page 0: §0§0This is the Deadly and Tragic tale of Mr. Whiskers The Cat of Death.
Page 1: §0§0A Man walked through a forest alone with a bottle of vodka. He was quite into it too so he was very drunk as he stumbled over rocks and sticks. As he continued to struggle through the forest he heard a odd and loud Meow in the distance.
Page 2: §0§0As he continued towards the annoying noise it kept geting louder and more odd sounding. Until he discovered a kitten sitting in a pile of sticks. The kitten was mostly black fur although their was some diffrent colors around his legs.
Page 3: §0§0The kitten stared at the man it had also stopped meowing entirely. Drunk as he was the man still remembered how much he hated cats so he continued to throw sevrel sticks and rocks on top of it thinking the kitten could never escape and would die slowly
Page 4: §0§0The man laughed to himself for a good minute before he dropped his bottle. He quickly retrieved it of course but to his suprise when he looked up the kitten was there stareing at him. This confused the man because he was sure he trapped the kitten earl
Page 5: §0§0The man cursed at the kitten in rage of how stupid he felt at the moment. The cat then said to the mans suprise. "Such a lovely set of words you have said. please continue" The man quickly screamed and fell backwords.
Page 6: §0§0To the mans suprise the kitten was on his chest within seconds looking into his eyes. while peering into them the man couldnt help but feel fear as he heard whispers all around him and throughout the forest. The cat continued to stare without speaking.
Page 7: §0§0The Man came to his senses soon and tried to get up only to find he lacked the strength as the kitten dug its claws into him and said. "No no §0no...not§0 so §0fast...you§0 and me have a few things to discuss." 
Page 8: §0§0The Man struggled much more feeling the claws begin to burn into his skin as the kitten spoke. "You think you can just kill a innocent cat in the woods and that nobody would miss §0it....its§0 just another pointless animal to you."
Page 9: §0§0"You think that i wouldnt have survived §0that.....well§0 sir...a word from the §0wise....when§0 you try to kill §0something........make§0 sure its really dead" The Man then felt only cold as his vision faded and the kitten soon walked away satisfied w

Page 0: Prologue:

Despite the downpour,
Chaos boldy ventured
on into the woeful
valley of
blackened elms.

The sopping sounds of
his splashing feet
echoed into the still,
rain-drenched woods.
Page 1: The burdens he bore
were great, not only
those on his
back, but those of the
heavy toll of sin on
his soul.

Everyone. Not a single
peasant spared. He
mused over his
decision to kill
everyone that looked
like the damned.
Page 2: "Perhaps my judgement
was too harsh. Yes,
that woman really
meant no harm."

He chuckled in
remembrance of the
mass slaughter in the
peaceful hamlet.
Chaos was a hearty
paladin-cow.
Page 3: He didn't stop to think
as he systematically
purged the entire
town.
Penance must be paid

He was on a spiritual
quest to cleanse his
sins he had done in
the company of the
alluring man mage,
Zhalfir.
Page 4: Chapter 1

-Seven weeks ago, the
hour of the
tendercrisp bacon elf
sandwich.
Page 5: Leaning on the
banister of the
dwarven trade ship,
Chaos saw the Mage's
mighty tower from at
least three fortnight's
walks.

The knight-errant
Chaos had recieved an
ultimatum from the
Dwarven Council.
Page 6: The council were the
rulers of the kingdom
Stoutschmeckle.

Chaos was a simple
man-cow; a mercenary
with a fancy title, and
was by far no means
a hero. He sported a
draping moustache, his
bedraggled hair the
typical burly brown of
his highland homeland.
Page 7: His armor was of
modest leather and
iron, and by chance an
unadorned steel cap
sat atop his head.

No true knight was he.

His equipment
consisted of a sturdy
black mace and a
round shield adorned
with a blue spiral.
Page 8: An ample sack covered
his cape, full of
whimsical odds and
ends necessary for
survival in the world in
which he resided.

The nights were long
and the days were hot,
but in time the sea
voyage met its end.
Page 9: Upon arrival, Chaos
strolled off of the
gangway and onto
solid ground.

The wind whipped up
from the grey ocean
as he beheld the
impressive edifice in
its full glory.
Page 10: Grim clouds slowly
whirled about the top
of the looming
structure, as if by
some...magical force,
perhaps.

He trundled toward
the base of the tower,
and shambled up the
incline to the
entrance.
Page 11: Chaos paused upon
the last step on the
top of the cascading
stairway that led to a
somber, shale door
set in the base of the
stupendous monolith.

A feeling of doubt
washed over him,
quickly being shook
away, knowing he must
press on.
Page 12: He forged his iron will
anew into steel and
reached for the goblin
shaped knocker on the
left of a similar, troll
headed one. 

He recoiled in horror
when the statue's
eyes rolled about
madly.
Page 13: 
"Wahts we got here
Elliott?" the sentient
copper goblin giggled.

"I thinks its fresh
meat for the master."
squealed Elliott the
troll head.
Page 14: "Shat-tap, bitch. You
sound like a shrieking
milkmaid who's just
seen a barewolf!"
retorted the goblin.
"What say you, you
magical trickeries and
metallic neon-eyed
fiends?" probed
Chaos.
"Am I not entitled to
enter the tower?"
Page 15: "Oh, certainly," replied
the goblin. "But we are
only here to forewarn
the supple fools who
Master lures in.
Secure your ass
plate, noble knight! For
Master desires
manflesh more than
anything these days.

But business is
business, so says I.
Page 16: So enter, but 
remember us well.

For we are the only
pair of knockers you'll
ever see in this tower!
Hee Hee!"

The two copper beings
parted to the sides as
the gates swung
open.
Page 17: Chaos set forth in
determination. He
passed through the
foreboding entrance
and came upon a
crossroads.

Three halls diverged,
marked by troubling,
leering gargoyles. The
left probed deep into
the innermost clutches
of the burly ground.
Page 18: The one ahead
consisted of a
seemingly endless
hallway. The rightmost
path led up a
mesmerizing staircase.

Chaos' keen snout
sensed a moist wind
emanating from the
spiral staircase.
Page 19: Knowing that the
master wizard. Zhalfir
could only exist in a
solid state in sopping
climes, he turned and
began to ascend the
staircase.
Page 20: "Ware the seductions
of Master," the goblin
echoed from behind.
"Even the straightest
arrow can be bent!"

After the warning,
Elliott let loose a
squeal that sounded a
little bit like a fire
hose sprayed through
an electric fan filled
with pelicans and -
Page 21: whistling track
coaches who had a
little too much time on
their hands and liked
to play tug of war
behind the snack
shack but one day the
tennis kids came by
and tipped it over,
subsequently trapping
them in the tomblike
waste wallow and he
hated his life
Page 22: and all the days after
no one looked at him
quite the same way, not
even his family and
that's what Elliott's
scream sounded like.

Chaos ventured
deeper into the
labyrinthine halls. As
he progressed, he
began to fall into
a dreamlike state.
Page 23: The winding corridors
seemed to shift as
inexplicable enigmas
danced within his
primitive manbrain.

His rhythmic footsteps
were punctuated by
mysterious sounds;
sudden soft laughter,
or the quiet shutting
of a door.
Page 24: He felt a singular
sense of disquiet as
he strode ever
quicker down the
corridor, fighting the
trancelike waves of
unreality.

He was suddenly
aware of a vast
presence behind him,
and he whirled
around.
Page 25: Shield set and mace
drawn back, but
nothing was there, and
Chaos began to doubt
his own sanity.

(Certainly it wasn't
there in the first
place because he kills
a shit load of innocent
people.)
Page 26: Then a notion arose.
Perhaps Chaos was
not really wandering
the halls, not even
moving. Gods! 

He was wandering
within his own mind! He
must get back to
consciousness right
now, lest he wake up
with a sore ass.
Page 27: He struggled through
the blurring mire of
the dreamworld, trying
to reach out for
consciousness.

Finally, with all of his
will, he snapped back
awake, and found
himself in a dim, velvet
room.
Page 28: His armor covered in
rose petals, but
thankfully still on.

And yet the menace of the years
Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.

Page 0: "Seldom we find," says Solomon Don Dunce,
"Half an idea in the profoundest sonnet.
Through all the flimsy things we see at once
As easily as through a Naples bonnet-
Trash of all trash!- how can a lady don it?
Page 1: Yet heavier far than your Petrarchan stuff-
Owl-downy nonsense that the faintest puff
Twirls into trunk-paper the while you con it."
Page 2: And, veritably, Sol is right enough.
The general tuckermanities are arrant
Bubbles- ephemeral and so transparent-
But this is, now- you may depend upon it-
Page 3: Stable, opaque, immortal- all by dint
Of the dear names that he concealed within 't.

Page 0: O say can you see by the dawn's early light,
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming,
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,
O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?
Page 1: And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there;
O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave,
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?
Page 2: On the shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep,
Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes,
What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep,
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?
Page 3: Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam,
In full glory reflected now shines in the stream:
'Tis the star-spangled banner, O! long may it wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

Page 4: And where is that band who so vauntingly swore
That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion,
A home and a country, should leave us no more?
Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps' pollution.
Page 5: No refuge could save the hireling and slave
From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave:
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave,
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.
Page 6: O thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand
Between their loved home and the war's desolation.
Blest with vict'ry and peace, may the Heav'n rescued land
Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation!
Page 7: Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,
And this be our motto: "In God is our trust."
And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!

    Book of Poetry

        by: Juelexi
Page 1: Daughter of the Rain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I watch from my window,
As the clouds begin to form,
My heart begins to flutter,
As I await the storm,

I watched as a raindrop fell,
The sun seeming to fade,
Page 2: Then before me I beheld,
a beauty of the rain,

Fair is her skin,
like the moon in the night,
Bright are her eyes,
like the dawns shining light,

Page 3: Golden is her hair,
Like the sun's stretching rays,
So beautiful, so fair,
Is the daughter of the rain,

She sings in the mist, 
With dew drops in her hair,
She then blows me a kiss,

Page 4: Oh so beautiful, so fair,

Like a pale gleaming rose,
Her lips gleam in the rain,
Her eye lids begin to close,
The rain begins to fade,
Page 5: When the shadows fall,
And clouds begin to form,
When the thunder calls,
I fear not the storm,

I sit and I wonder,
At this child so rare,
My heart she has plundered,
Yet I give not a care,
Page 6: Hold her I can't,
To touch is a dream,
She comes and she goes,
Her voice oh so sweet,

Like a winter's chill,
clinging to a midsummer day,
She came,
Like a shadow that must pass away,
She went,
Page 7: So beautiful, so fair,
Oh daughter of the rain,

               ~end

Page 8:   Cruel Happiness
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sorrows come,
and sorrows go,
The tears that fall,
are sad I know,

But here in this moment,
I reach out my hand,
Greedy I may seem,
but don't you understand?
Page 9: Sorrows come,
in an abundance of pain,
But denying yourself,
only adds to the rain,

Happiness is limited,
that's why I hold tight,
I can't control the sadness,
it's to much of a fight,
Page 10: In holding true to myself,
by reaching out my hand to you,
Happiness can be found,
if only, between us two...

               ~end
Page 11:      ..:::My Place:::..
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Shadows and hardships, life just a drag... sunk into misery at a world gone bad... Sunshine no longer, and no peaceful rain... Warm light on brown bodies.. chilled rivers untamed...
Page 12: Oh splendid silence, warm rays of washed sun, Oh peaceful valley where only I can come... Fields of flowers basked in all the light, soft wind, silent slumber... everything so right...

Oh where only I go, is a place that only I know...
Page 13: Where dreams and life are one and no heartache can come, Joy in silent breeze, among flowers in fields of green.. where tall trees touch the sky and no beginning can mean no end... Warmth, splendid warmth, that forever comes from within...
Page 14: Lying in a field, arms out stretched, among valleys so large the sky has no depth... Where green trees never turn to brown, and long wispy grasses are soft and sound. The animals untamed yet alive and free, are there in that place that only I can see...
Page 15: Clouds of all shapes and wind almost visible, the rain is a friend and nothing is miserable... Oh in that silent warmth, the place I miss the most.. No longer can I go there, the memory now.. a bitter ghost...
                    
                  ~end
Page 16:     Captured Faces
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Silent laugter
Arrognat frowns
Caught and plastered
Cut and bound

Forever smiles
Eerie laughs
Joyous memories
And dark past...
Page 17: Forever silent
Tears that fall
Obnoxious poses
Silent calls

Captured faces
Fine and dark
Silent laughter
Eyes that spark


Page 18: Forever captured
Cruel or kind
Cut and plastered
Bound for time...

                  ~end
Page 19:       *Stranger*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Shadows fall upon the road,
The sun slowly decends,
Old dusty boots begin to slow,
As the day now comes to an end...
Page 20: Stranger in a world of shadow,
Where do you go?
Why does no one follow
On your long and lonely road?

You sleep under moon and star,
The wind your lullaby,
Tell me stranger from afar,
Why do you cry?
Page 21: Though tears you shed,
When the lonely winds blow,
Your feet still tread,
On that long and lonely road...

Stranger in a a world of sorrow,
The night has passed on by,

Page 22: Still no one has followed,
Is that why you cry?

No friends to be found,
No one to care,
Footprints on the ground,
But only one pair,
Page 23: Drowning in a sea of sorrows,
That comes from lonely trails,
Stranger who does travel,
I pray you farewell...

                 ~end
Page 24:       -Whispers-
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Lil one,
In my arms,
You talk to me,
Of all past harms,

You whisper you're sorry,
Forgiveness you ask,
"Take all my sins,
Please, Father, and cast..."
Page 25: You then go on to tell me,
What you've done in a day,
Whispering in great detail,
Everything, you did say...

You tell me of some people,
Some that are dear to you,
Page 26: You pray for your loved ones,
And those that are new,

You tell me all your troubles,
Worries and fears,
You ask that I help you,
And stay by you near,
Page 27: I hold you tighter,
And place peace on your mind,
I don't forsake my children,
Never leave them behind,

You close your eyes softly,
And ask me for strength,
Page 28: You make me smile,
As you ask me for faith,

Dear child, I'll be there,
When life gets to rough,
I'll be your pillar of strength,
And hold you in my love,
Page 29: Some days will be harder,
And you won't see me anywhere,
You may think I've forsaken,
But I'll always be there,

Tears begin to fall,
As you ask, "What if I fail? What if I can't do it..?"
Page 30: But child, I will prevail,

Two pairs of footprints,
Yours and mine,
But when you see only one pair,
I've carried you, that's why...

You then begin to drift,
There against my arms,
Page 31: You stretch slightly,
And then wake in alarm,

Your eyes turn solemn, 
And your face downcast,
"I'm sorry, dear Lord,
I'm tired, and don't think I'll last..."


Page 32: You looked so sad,
There against my chest,
I couldn't help but smile,
And whisper, "Just Rest..."

Lil one.. My child,
You've crawled unto my lap,

Page 33: I've held you in my arms,
And in my warmth you've wrapped...

My child, I love you,
Rest easy in my grace,
To fall asleep in whispers,
There is no better way...

                  ~end

Page 0: §0§0Nicole waved at the security guard at the building across the street, causing him to give her a puzzled look.§0
§0§0They of course didn't know eachother, it was unsurprising considering as a deadly assassin she rarely befriended
Page 1: §0§0security guards, it would be sort of like a bank robber befriending a cashier.§0
§0§0She walked across the street smiling sweetly, the guard still looking mildly puzzled.§0
§0§0'Hey, it's Bill isn't it?' she said 'We met at that thing last week?'
Page 2: §0§0'I have no idea who you are' he replied in a rather toneless voice. 'Also my name is Steve'§0
§0§0'Right! Steve of course, how could I get you mixed up with Bill!' Nicole smoothly replied.
Page 3: §0§0'My name isn't Steve either, you're either attempting to distract me or bluff your way past me and it's not going to work' he stiffly replied.§0
§0§0'Well it was worth a shot, would you mind holding this for me a second?' 
Page 4: §0§0said Nicole passing him a pink umbrella with a floral design.§0
§0§0The security guard looked amused and accepted the umbrella, which immediately exploded killing him, Nicole stepped over the body and continued into the
Page 5: §0§0building....§0
§0§0The lobby was decorated for Christmas and there were five security guards pointing guns at her and demanding she get on the floor. §0
§0§0They clearly did not mean that she should beam at them and 
Page 6: §0§0sit on the floor cross legged but this is nonetheless what she did, one of the security guards told her such in no uncertain words and when she refused he rather rudely attempted to shoot her.
Page 7: §0§0He did not appear to realise that she had earlier snuck into the security guard's armoury through a ventilation shaft and replaced all of the guard's guns with confetti firing replicas.§0
§0§0After a rather amusing but less than
Page 8: §0§0deadly confetti shower she proceeded to grab a Christmas wreath off a wall and strangle one of the guards with it, she took a few deadly throwing 'Christmas' stars out of her bag and down went the second and third guard.
Page 9: §0§0As the second two bolted she started humming 'Rudolf the red nosed reindeer', triggering the sound activated Santa-shaped bomb she casually lobbed after them.§0
§0§0She proceeded up the elevator to the top floor, the boss sat
Page 10: §0§0in a comfortable ergonomic chair as the humming assassin walked into his office, he immediately pulled a shotgun out from underneath his desk...
Page 11: §0§0Nicole quickly dodged out of the way of the first shot and grabbed some christmas lights off the wall, she did a backflip over the next shot and landed perfectly behind the boss, wrapped the christmas lights around his neck and threw him out
Page 12: §0§0the window.§0
§0§0She whistled as she calmly stepped out of the window and began to absail down the building using the christmas lights, as she passed the boss she gave him a friendly kick. She calmly walked away from the scenes of
Page 13: §0§0destruction and smiled at the firemen and policemen, she grabbed one of them on the arm.§0
§0§0'Hey, you're really cute, stand two feet to the left for a minute'§0
§0§0The fireman bemusedly complied and two seconds later all of the others were
Page 14: §0§0crushed as the top of the building exploded.

Page 0: §0    Legend of the
   Moon and Stars
       Chapter 1
Now once upon a time within the realm of the Cloud realm there was great peace and happiness upon the gods that lived there.
The queen and king of the Cloud Realm had two sons, Arthaheart the youngest,
Page 1: §0and Mundiken (originally Aurelius) the oldest brother.
Now no one was brave enough to venture into the Space Realm, an empty black void of pure nothingness and a portal of inky realms unlit and unexplored.
Now queen and king of the Cloud Realm were 
Page 2: §0curious and went into this black void called the Space Realm. Now when they went they had unfortunately never returned. Some say that they had vanished, a beast had ate them whole, they had been killed by the unknown, or worse got lost in the endless

Page 3: §0darkness. No one knew where they had vanished but chaos began to erupt between the gods. The queen and king had forgotten to appoint one of their sons heir to the throne to rule the great and mighty Cloud Realm.



Page 4: §0      Chapter 2
As said chaos and anger erupted. The gods panicked. They had no ruler and were scared for their Cloud Realm's fate.
They were calmed down once Arthaheart and Mundiken announced that there would be a king.
However Mundiken and Arthaheart
Page 5: §0had never known how they would settle this.
The brothers loved each other dearly but they slowly began to worry with each passing day with no king.
Now the brothers watched upon the mortals below their beloved Cloud Realm and saw how they fought and
Page 6: §0killed to become king.
Now Arthaheart and Mundiken grimaced at the mortals ways to become a king.
The brothers love for each other was beginning to weaken. Both of them were ready for either to make their move to the throne.
They wondered when one of the
Page 7: §0would announce who they would want to rule.
Alas, time passed and the gods became impatient with the decision that had not yet been made.
The brothers began to fear each other. They had many fights.
          
Page 8: §0        Chapter 3
Now the brothers fought viciously and many of the gods traveled to stop them yet the brothers charged.
The clouds blew away revealing the dark night void of sky above.
Now Arthaheart an Mundiken on the impact of the charge 
Page 9: §0caused the gods to blow to bits and pieces of glowing dust that blew into space.
Now the enraged Mundiken had killed and turned his brother Arthaheart into bits and pieces.
Going mad he went unto the mortals to take his horrible wrath upon them! Now the 
Page 10: §0gods saw this and formed an impenetrable cage around Mundiken.
Not only that but this became the moon. The other gods however that had died...their remains floated into space and then turned into glowig bits and pieces that became stars.

Page 11: §0However the real legend was this....
The moon that held Mundiken captive had even though powerful to keep him inside Mundiken could move it.
The moon rotates around the world of mortals because Mundiken searches for Arthaheart's remains believing to take
Page 12: §0control of the Cloud Realm throne.
However the stars filled the stars to comfort the mortals that Mundiken would never be unleashed and destroy them all.
In the end though this story was sadly forgotten. It lives in this very book. It lives as the Legend

Page 0: Far over the Misty Mountains cold,
To dungeons deep and caverns old,
We must away, ere break of day,
To seek our pale enchanted gold.
The dwarves of yore made mighty spells, While hammers fell like ringing bells,
Page 1: In places deep, where dark things sleep,
In hollow halls beneath the fells.

For ancient king and elvish lord
There many a gleaming golden hoard
They shaped and wrought,
Page 2: and light they caught,
To hide in gems on hilt of sword.

On silver necklaces they strung
The flowering stars, on crowns they hung
The dragon-fire,
Page 3: on twisted wire
They meshed the light of moon and sun.

Far over the Misty Mountains cold,
To dungeons deep and caverns old,
We must away, ere break of day,
To claim our long-forgotten gold.
Page 4: Goblets they carved there for themselves,
And harps of gold, where no man delves
There lay they long, and many a song
Was sung unheard by men or elves.

The pines were roaring on the heights,
The wind was moaning in the night,
Page 5: The fire was red, it flaming spread,
The trees like torches blazed with light.  

The bells were ringing in the dale,
And men looked up with faces pale.
The dragon's ire, more fierce than fire,
Laid low their towers and houses frail.
Page 6: The mountain smoked beneath the moon.
The dwarves, they heard the tramp of doom.
They fled the hall to dying fall
Beneath his feet, beneath the moon.
Page 7: Far over the Misty Mountains grim,
To dungeons deep and caverns dim,
We must away, ere break of day,
To win our harps and gold from him!

Page 0: Farming

There are many different types of farming, the easiest are cocoa farming and nether wart farming.
Cocoa--To farm cocoa, simply place cocoa beans on a jungle wood block, and harvest when the pod turns bright orange. 
Page 1: Then, replant and repeat.
Nether Wart--Place on soul sand and wait until it is about 1 block tall, then destroy it and plant again.
Sugar--Place a sugar cane on sand or dirt next to water, then wait until it is 3 blocks high, then punch the  block high 
Page 2: piece. This should give you 2 more sugar canes. 
Wheat--Carrots-Potatoes--place near water or irrigation system for best results. They need to be harvested when fully grown, then replanted.
Melons--Pumpkins--Place the seed on plowed, irrigated land, but 
Page 3: with a place next to the plant for the melon-or pumpkin to grow. When the plant is gown, detroy it to gain melon slices or a pumpkin (depending on what type of plant it is.).

ANIMAL FARMING--When farming animals, make sure thay cannot
Page 4: move more than 20 blocks in any direction (Except from up or down), otherwise, they'll despawn! Breed them often to get the best results, and remember that everything eats wheat...apart from chickens, which eat seeds. 
Page 5:   --Your Kingdom--

Page 0:    ..:::Tower Bridge:::..
         
   Part one of three.

       By: Juelexi
Page 1: When I was but a child,
Only three years of age,
Wearing bonnets and my bottle, 
With everything my way,

My daddy knelt beside me,
He kissed my little face,
`Listen up my little sweet,
Today's a great day!'
Page 2: He smiled so boldly,
His eyes so large and bright,
I laughed and I giggled,
I smiled at his delight,

`How would you like,
The best gift of all,'
He said it so crazily,
I thought it a ball!

Page 3: `There is nothing other,
There is no compare,
What I'll bring you is a brother!
Now isn't that dear!'

He smiled and he laughed,
Telling me of love we would share,
Of friendships that'd last,
Of brotherly care!
Page 4: I thought it the best thing,
To happen to me,
I thought it so splendid,
I laughed out with glee!

He kissed me goodbye,
On the tip of my nose,
`Behave you little tyke,
Your Papa will know!'

Page 5: I waited the whole day,
Tell sun nearly set,
My mother not worried,
Yet boy did I fret!

My bedtime was nigh,
When daddy came back,
His mood just as cherry,
No, nothing was lack!

Page 6: I was the picture of happiness,
So full of joy,
When daddy showed me his bundle,
I saw it was a boy!

Much older than I,
His face smudged and brown,
I looked on in horror,
I made not a sound!
Page 7: Dirty blond hair,
With soft wispy curls,
His face soft with slumber,
I thought I would hurl!

No brother of mine,
I wanted to scream,
But stare on in horror,
I couldn't even breathe!
Page 8: My daddy was delighted,
He thought I was too,
He gave the boy my mother,
And she began to coo!

I wanted to pout,
I wanted to cry,
I knew it no use,
I let out a sigh!

Page 9: The days that would follow,
Were just as I thought,
The boy was a terror,
Yet still had my spot!

The pride of my father,
He won right away,
The love of my mother,
She gave without save!
Page 10: When backs would turn,
The terror would rise,
He'd push and he'd tease,
And then smile into their eyes!

The boy was much older,
Three years or so I'd say,
Page 11: My father took him everywhere,
My mother made him cakes!

I was unhappy,
And very sad-bound,
I cried all the time,
But this brought me frowns!
Page 12: Action I began to take,
And became a terror too,
No longer was it all for me,
There was war between us two!

I never had to fight for things,
Things like a mothers love,
Page 13: But every day the war kept on,
And I learned to kick and shove,

For years the battles kept it up,
Each day the same old thing,
One would try the harder still,
To win my mothers please,
Page 14: I told my mother when I could,
The horrors of that boy,
She would laugh and softly speak,
`Boys will be boys!'

	Title: Cow's Tale: Ch1
	Author: XxChaosIncxX
	Type: Written

Page 0: §9Prologue:

§0Despite the downpour,
Chaos boldy ventured
on into the woeful
valley of
blackened elms.

The sopping sounds of
his splashing feet
echoed into the still,
rain-drenched woods.
Page 1: The burdens he bore
were great, not only
those on his
back, but those of the
heavy toll of sin on
his soul.

Everyone. Not a single
peasant spared. He
mused over his
decision to kill
everyone that looked
like the damned.
Page 2: "Perhaps my judgement
was too harsh. Yes,
that woman really
meant no harm."

He chuckled in
remembrance of the
mass slaughter in the
peaceful hamlet.
Chaos was a hearty
paladon-cow.
Page 3: He didn't stop to think
as he systematically
purged the entire
town.
Penance must be paid

He was on a spiritual
quest to cleanse his
sins he had done in
the company of the
alluring man mage,
Zhalfir.
Page 4: §6Chapter 1

§5-Seven weeks ago, the
hour of the
tendercrisp bacon elf
sandwich.

Page 5: Leaning on the
banister of the
dwarven trade ship,
Chaos saw the Mage's
mighty tower from at
least three fortnight's
walks.

The knight-errant
Chaos had recieved an
ultimatum from the
Dwarven Council.
Page 6: The council were the
rulers of the kingdom
Stoutschmeckle.

Chaos was a simple
man-cow; a mercenary
with a fancy title, and
was by far no means
a hero. He sported a
draping moustache, his
bedraggled hair the
typical burly brown of
his highland homeland.
Page 7: His armor was of
modest leather and
iron, and by chance an
unadorned steel cap
sat atop his head.

No true knight was he.

His equipment
consisted of a sturdy
black mace and a
round shield adorned
with a blue spiral.
Page 8: An ample sack covered
his cape, full of
whimsical odds and
ends necessary for
survival in the world in
which he resided.

The nights were long
and the days were hot,
but in time the sea
voyage met its end.
Page 9: Upon arrival, Chaos
strolled off of the
gangway and onto
solid ground.

The wind whipped up
from the grey ocean
as he beheld the
impressive edifice in
its full glory.
Page 10: Grim clouds slowly
whirled about the top
of the looming
structure, as if by
some...magical force,
perhaps.

He trundled toward
the base of the tower,
and shambled up the
incline to the
entrance.
Page 11: Chaos paused upon
the last step on the
top of the cascading
stairway that led to a
somber, shale door
set in the base of the
stupendous monolith.

A feeling of doubt
washed over him,
quickly being shook
away, knowing he must
press on.
Page 12: He forged his iron will
anew into steel and
reached for the goblin
shaped knocker on the
left of a similar, troll
headed one. 

He recoiled in horror
when the statue's
eyes rolled about
madly.
Page 13: "Wahts we got here
Elliott?" the sentient
copper goblin giggled.

"I thinks its fresh
meat for the master."
squealed Elliott the
troll head.
Page 14: Shat-tap, bitch. You
sound like a shrieking
milkmaid who's just
seen a barewolf!
Page 15: "Oh, certainly," replied
the goblin. "But we are
only here to forewarn
the supple fools who
Master lures in.
Secure your ass
plate, noble knight! For
Master desires
manflesh more than
anything these days.

But business is
business, so says I.
Page 16: So enter, but 
remember us well.

For we are the only
pair of knockers you'll
ever see in this tower!
Hee Hee!"

The two copper beings
parted to the sides as
the gates swung
open.
Page 17: Chaos set forth in
determination. He
passed through the
foreboding entrance
and came upon a
crossroads.

Three halls diverged,
marked by troubling,
leering gargoyles. The
left probed deep into
the innermost clutches
of the burly ground.
Page 18: The one ahead
consisted of a
seemingly endless
hallway. The rightmost
path led up a
mesmerizing staircase.

Chaos' keen snout
sensed a moist wind
emanating from the
spiral staircase.
Page 19: Knowing that the
master wizard. Zhalfir
could only exist in a
solid state in sopping
climes, he turned and
began to ascend the
staircase.
Page 20: "Ware the seductions
of Master," the goblin
echoed from behind.
"Even the straightest
arrow can be bent!"

After the warning,
Elliott let loose a
squeal that sounded a
little bit like a fire
hose sprayed through
an electric fan filled
with pelicans and -
Page 21: whistling track
coaches who had a
little too much time on
their hands and liked
to play tug of war
behind the snack
shack but one day the
tennis kids came by
and tipped it over,
subsequently trapping
them in the tomblike
waste wallow and he
hated his life
Page 22: and all the days after
no one looked at him
quite the same way, not
even his family and
that's what Elliott's
scream sounded like.

Chaos ventured
deeper into the
labyrinthine halls. As
he progressed, he
began to fall into
a dreamlike state.
Page 23: The winding corridors
seemed to shift as
inexplicable enigmas
danced within his
primitive manbrain.

His rhythmic footsteps
were punctuated by
mysterious sounds;
sudden soft laughter,
or the quiet shutting
of a door. 
Page 24: He felt a singular
sense of disquiet as
he strode ever
quicker down the
corridor, fighting the
trancelike waves of
unreality.

He was suddenly
aware of a vast
presence behind him,
and he whirled
around.
Page 25: Shield set and mace
drawn back, but
nothing was there, and
Chaos began to doubt
his own sanity.

§7(Certainly it wasn't
there in the first
place because he kills
a shit load of innocent
people.)
Page 26: Then a notion arose.
Perhaps Chaos was
not really wandering
the halls, not even
moving. Gods! 

He was wandering
within his own mind! He
must get back to
consciousness right
now, lest he wake up
with a sore ass.

Page 27: He struggled through
the blurring mire of
the dreamworld, trying
to reach out for
consciousness.

Finally, with all of his
will, he snapped back
awake, and found
himself in a dim, velvet
room.
Page 28: His armor covered in
rose petals, but
thankfully still on.

Page 0: All the world's a stage,
And all the men and women merely players;
They have their exits and their entrances,
And one man in his time plays many parts,
His acts being seven ages. At first, the infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
Page 1: Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
Page 2: Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,
Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation
Page 3: Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
In fair round belly with good capon lined,
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
And so he plays his part.
Page 4: The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;
His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
Page 5: For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
Page 6: That ends this strange eventful history,
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.

The True Origin of

HEROBRINE





-by: axlgx
Page 1: As you might believe, or even know, Herobrine is the believed 'Ghost' of the brother of the creator of Minecraft, A.K.A. Noth. But, is that true? Does he even has a brother?
The answer is yes, he has a borther. But, then what is Herobrine?
Page 2: Pretty simple, it's not a ghost, not a God, and by surprise, it's not a Mob. It's, for my point of view, a prototype of NPC for the most player-like creature.
But well, it didn't went well at all. I think that it was some kind of 'follower' in the...
Page 3: beguinning of Minecraft develop.
But it went rogue and basically did what it does now, even trought it has been 'removed'.
Not a ghost, Not a God. A Rogue NPC, or that's what i think.
Don't trust other Herobrine legends,
Page 4: since most of the people outside lie.
The most important part is what YOU believe. Share your opininon, but don't make it the truth, since it's umpossible to know the truth at all.

§0
§0Project BoSW was created by a idea and theory of a plugin that it can be simply bypassed by a ever generating redstone machine that is classfisied as a entity, seperating the fabric of the server creating  a tear in the border.
Page 2: Once this study was completed it was proved to be true and showed little to no negative effects, in that region you can breifely walk over the border, but you will be TP'd back. However the machine numbs the border so players can enter, so far no

Page 1: D1  "The cradle of civilzation"§0
§0
§0Muttsworld has a large cradle in which multiple civilzations exist. A town called Bosencha exists near a few biomes in 4 regions. Being iron10, boat12, grass12, and rubble10. This town is owned by current
Page 2: N.FR. Head builder iBrionac, however he gave the to Head of Redstoning, MRJWKD, and head of Negotiations and defense, PECES_MADAM. The town is small and has less than 10 people within the town. The town has Also surronding colonies which are usually made 
Page 3: of the resources surrounding the town.§0
§0Most of these are made of Darkoak wood, and spruce wood. Bosencha and MypetLion & MypetTigers town where made of resources away from§0
§0the town, instead of next to it. The estimated spending of
Page 4: Bosencha is 10-80 Mums per year. For there heavy building projects. The town in terms of Civil rights is high, however, there poltical freedome is small, because of a lack of government (untill he joined forces with the NFR.), and no econmy. However, the 
Page 5: region is rich with trees, but for the most part is heavily disturbed by settlers. Who have destroyed much of the surroundings forests.  §0
§0
§0Another bigger civilzation in the region is joined with Bosencha is MyPetLion's
Page 6: & MyPetTigers town. There town is a Monarchy and is rich with resources such as Diamonds, Iron, stone, and wood. They are rich in resources with a wealthy econmy. with high civil rights. Political freedome is unknown. The town has been inactive and has 
Page 7: not been run since August 17, 2015. The town is now abandon. The town is also poorly built, have atleast over 3 remodels in the form of a castle. §0
§0
§0To the left of Lion's town is a small group of colonies that exist in a few regions. 1
Page 8: beign grassland12. Another being redstone14, and the finale being boat12.§0
§0
§0However the largest town within the region is in Lava13, about 1000 blocks away from Bosencha, and 800 from MyPetLion's town. It is owned by xXGirlGamingXx. The town has over
Page 9: 30 people within the town.  The town has excelnt civil rights, with no formal rule of government, except for set out laws. They also have no econmy but still has valuable resources near and under it, Such as water, oak trees, and lava. Which are somewhat 
Page 10: common but not very.§0
§0
§0These civilzations exists in a area known as the Middle cradle. To the left of the middle cradle, is the left-wing cradle. Which is another area with rich resources near the water on Arzakias sea. But near the last part of the
Page 11: middle cradle are a few other colonies/civilzations. 1 is a floating city which has unknown orgins, another is a town of settlers which are raiders. And a small swamp town with also unknown orgins. It has rich resources and a no known governing system. A 
Page 12: extremly old town had been recently rediscovered by iBrionac. which was made during the 1.7 ages. And is a modern town. The current owner gone. The town has no known governing system with any known civil rights or political freedome.§0
§0And itself is more or
Page 13: less a town. But rather just a place with buildings with a prior system of government, which ceases to exist now.§0
§0
§0"The left cradle"§0
§0
§0The left cradle of civilzations can be reached by region or boat. The region also has a bridge which 
Page 14: can be walked through going through regions. And has a piece of land modified by mods/admins during early days. A small

§0
§0It was a normal day for Adam Finkelhimer.§0
§0He was having a sleepover with his friend, John. They were playing ''Hide and go shoot''. It is a game where if the seeker finds the hider, The
Page 1: seeker gets to shoot the hider with a water gun. Anyway, Adam was the hider. Unlucky day for him, because he had no defence. but his day just got more unlucky.
Page 2: Paragraugh 2: The danger begins...§0
§0
§0Adam worried. The clothes that he was wearing were New. He forgot about them but now he had no time to change. He desparately Climbed a tree in hope of being safe from John. John saw Adam, and Adam instantly scrambled
Page 3: up the tree. Then he lost his foothold and slipped a little. John screamed ''Get down from there! You could get hurt!!'' Adam didnt belive him. ''YOUR JUST GOING TO SHOOT ME!!!!'' screamed Adam. then he climbed up a little more, and as he reached the top,
Page 4: both of his feet slipped. He was holding on to a peice of bark with his hands slipping. ''uhh... help! im slipping!'' John rushed inside, to grab a phone and call 911. (no ladder could reach that high and he didnt dare to go up) He smashed the numbers 911

	Title: GRIEF:THESTART
	Author: live_4
	Type: Written

Page 0: Standing there
wondering what I should do with myself
from here on in.
I had just losted everything i had
with a 3 inch deep gash in my swolen leg,
I could barley think straight. The pain was slowly going away but atill haunting me.
What did i do to 
Page 1: deserve this.
All because of griefers.
Page 2:      CHAPTER 1

It all began 
when i Arrived home 
to fined it completly trashed, I had just finished making my cosy fireplace in my living room, 4 day ago. I had just arrived home from selling my wood that i  had choped that day.
Page 3: All my wheat was gone and my chests full of wood i was to sell the next day was gone.
My diamond were gone as well as my gold clock that i had dug up when i was a boy playing in the dirt.
I continued to search downstairs. But It just got worse, all my 
Page 4: walls were loged out. I heard a misterious rustling noice, it wascoming from the mine. I rased down my stairs into my mine. I just realised why he was down ther. Last night i was down there and i struck gold. I left it there for me to dig out the next day
Page 5: . But guess what he was used my diamonds to make a diamond pickaxe. He was just finishing up on mining the gold. Oi you i said He turned around and gave me a dirty look. He slashed my leg with the pic and ran by me up to the surface. I chased after him 

Page 6: with the seering pain in my leg. I reached the surface he ran up the stairs turning workbenches and furnaces in my way, But i easily avoided the obsticles. He opened the door and ran out then i followed him, and DONG, He knocked me out with the diamond 
Page 7: pic he crafted out of my diamonds that he griefed. When i woke up I realised thathe must of stood behind the door and hit me when 
i cam around the corrner.
Page 8:       CHAPTER 2

So here I am wondering what to do withmyself from here on in. I have nothing. I have an idea, I will try and get the griefers fingerprints so i can identify him and track him down. I whent to the market to see if there was any fingerprint
Page 9: trackers for sale. But get this, it was 1000 DOLLERS, and i would be able to afford if it wasnt for that griefer that stole all my stuff.
So I guess i might just have to sell my block of land. so i got a loan from the bank and whent and brought the finger
Page 10: I scaned the hole house but no sighn of any fingerprints but mine. This guy must have been a proffesional griefer. Well today i put my house up for sale.
and whent out to search for the griefer. Because if he is that good sombody must know him.
Page 11:        CREDITS

	Title: The Name Steve
	Author: jjp1234
	Type: Written

Page 0: Don't ask me what I'm doing here, because I don't know. One day, I woke up in the middle of a forest, covered in snow, devoid of all memory and sense of identity. Why? I have no clue. It almost doesn't matter. I spent the first couple of hours calling for
Page 1: help, wandering around hoping I'd fine someone nearby. After a while, I came to the reluctant conclusion that I was well and truly isolated: no sounds of human voices, no hum of tires on distant roadways; nothing but the trill of far off birds and
Page 2: rustling branches in the wind. There might have been a cow nearby from all the mooing, but I couldn't find it.§0
§0I might not have know who I am, or why I woke up in this snowy forest, but that didn't mean I was going to sit down and let depression take me
Page 3: along with the wolves. I needed a plan of action, need to find a way to survive. But first, a man needs to know himself before he can trust himself, and because my old name was lost to my departed memory. I have decided to call myself Steve. Its a good 
Page 4: name.I spent some time searching the area, looking for anything that might be useful to me. Tools and weapons would be my first priority--don't ask me how I knew, but I could tell the forest would be dangerous at night, I don't know why. There
Page 5: wasn't much, not even a single fallen branch on the ground, just smooth snow and straight pine trees. i tried to grab hold of a few rocks peeking up from the soil,but they were firmly stuck. I'd need something to pry them free, or maybe break them away. I
Page 6: spotted a tree nearby and went to it, running my hands over the dark brown bark. It was a good tree.. strong and healthy.§0
§0
§0So I punched it.§0
§0
§0Pulp and bark flew as my hard fists broke chunk after chunk.
Page 7:  I gritted my teeth against the jarring in my arms and kept going until the whole thing broke through and crashed to the §0ground.Chest§0 heaving from the exertion, I gathered the wood and sat down, examining the pieces. I broke some of the longer chunks into
Page 8: thick sticks, then stabbed on of them into piece of wood shaped like a blade.§0
§0I grinned as I hefted the wooden axe I'd made, then swung it around experimentally. It felt good. I used the axe to fell several more tress until I had enough wood to make all
Page 9: the tools I needed: a shovel, sword and a pickaxe--the latter of which I used to break those stubborn stone from the ground. I stowed the rocks away for later use and strapped the tools to my back. I kept the sword out though, the feeling of danger in the
Page 10: woods tickling the back of my mind. Thus armed, I set off in search of food and shelter.I won't bore you with the details of my struggle against starvation and §0wolves.Suffice§0 it to say, it was a struggle. I fought, bled and conquered. I stumbled over
Page 11: hills and down into water-filled valleys, climbing trees to see the path ahead. I slew cows and ate their flesh to stay alive.I fell off cliffs and broke bones, spending days waiting for them to heal. I briefly marveled at how quickly the wounds mended,
Page 12: but wasted no time in pressing on once they did. At night times, I was attacked by monsters, proving my intuition about the forest to be correct. I hid from the darkness, lighting the small mud huts I'd built along the way with torches until the sim rose
Page 13: once again. I never knew why the world I'd woken up in was filled with skeletons and zombies, but it didn't really matter, I bashed their heads in with stone swords nonetheless. There were more questions to be had than answers, and I knew I would never
Page 14: know half of them.§0
§0
§0I had to SURVIVE!§0
§0
§0Weeks later, exhausted, clothes ripped and torn, blood from numerous cuts on my legs trailing into my socks, I finally found mountains. Majestic. I climbed them each, looking for the ideal spot to build a home
Page 15: far away from the oprressive trees and monster-filled shadows of the forest.I avoided the caves beneath those mountains, fearful of skeletons and massive spiders.I knew I would have to venture inside them eventually, but no then. I finally found a flat
Page 16: topped peak that overlooked the forests to the eats, and the ocean to the west. From its heights, I would be able to see the while land, and defend my homestead from intruders.§0
§0
§0It was good.
Page 17: That was a few months ago. I've since become used to this way of life, in this strange land. The name of Steve fits me like a glove, and I am the master of my modest stone home. I've raised cattle, planted wheat, and baked bread. I've explored those
Page 18: mysterious caved and returned the victor,bringing home coal for fires, iron for tools and armor, precious gold and even a priceless diamond. I am king of all I see, master of this forsaken land And then yesterday, my house blew up.... The building in 
Page 19: peices, the monsters who blew this place to shambles. I gave them a name. I call them§0

	Title: Cow's Tale: Ch1
	Author: XxChaosIncxX
	Type: Written

Page 0: §9Prologue:

§0Despite the downpour,
Chaos boldy ventured
on into the woeful
valley of
blackened elms.

The sopping sounds of
his splashing feet
echoed into the still,
rain-drenched woods.
Page 1: The burdens he bore
were great, not only
those on his
back, but those of the
heavy toll of sin on
his soul.

Everyone. Not a single
peasant spared. He
mused over his
decision to kill
everyone that looked
like the damned.
Page 2: "Perhaps my judgement
was too harsh. Yes,
that woman really
meant no harm."

He chuckled in
remembrance of the
mass slaughter in the
peaceful hamlet.
Chaos was a hearty
paladin-cow.
Page 3: He didn't stop to think
as he systematically
purged the entire
town.
Penance must be paid

He was on a spiritual
quest to cleanse his
sins he had done in
the company of the
alluring man mage,
Zhalfir.
Page 4: §6Chapter 1

§5-Seven weeks ago, the
hour of the
tendercrisp bacon elf
sandwich.
Page 5: Leaning on the
banister of the
dwarven trade ship,
Chaos saw the Mage's
mighty tower from at
least three fortnight's
walks.

The knight-errant
Chaos had recieved an
ultimatum from the
Dwarven Council.
Page 6: The council were the
rulers of the kingdom
Stoutschmeckle.

Chaos was a simple
man-cow; a mercenary
with a fancy title, and
was by far no means
a hero. He sported a
draping moustache, his
bedraggled hair the
typical burly brown of
his highland homeland.
Page 7: His armor was of
modest leather and
iron, and by chance an
unadorned steel cap
sat atop his head.

No true knight was he.

His equipment
consisted of a sturdy
black mace and a
round shield adorned
with a blue spiral.
Page 8: An ample sack covered
his cape, full of
whimsical odds and
ends necessary for
survival in the world in
which he resided.

The nights were long
and the days were hot,
but in time the sea
voyage met its end.
Page 9: Upon arrival, Chaos
strolled off of the
gangway and onto
solid ground.

The wind whipped up
from the grey ocean
as he beheld the
impressive edifice in
its full glory.
Page 10: Grim clouds slowly
whirled about the top
of the looming
structure, as if by
some...magical force,
perhaps.

He trundled toward
the base of the tower,
and shambled up the
incline to the
entrance.
Page 11: Chaos paused upon
the last step on the
top of the cascading
stairway that led to a
somber, shale door
set in the base of the
stupendous monolith.

A feeling of doubt
washed over him,
quickly being shook
away, knowing he must
press on.
Page 12: He forged his iron will
anew into steel and
reached for the goblin
shaped knocker on the
left of a similar, troll
headed one. 

He recoiled in horror
when the statue's
eyes rolled about
madly.
Page 13: 
"Wahts we got here
Elliott?" the sentient
copper goblin giggled.

"I thinks its fresh
meat for the master."
squealed Elliott the
troll head.
Page 14: Shat-tap, bitch. You
sound like a shrieking
milkmaid who's just
seen a barewolf!
Page 15: "Oh, certainly," replied
the goblin. "But we are
only here to forewarn
the supple fools who
Master lures in.
Secure your ass
plate, noble knight! For
Master desires
manflesh more than
anything these days.

But business is
business, so says I.
Page 16: So enter, but 
remember us well.

For we are the only
pair of knockers you'll
ever see in this tower!
Hee Hee!"

The two copper beings
parted to the sides as
the gates swung
open.
Page 17: Chaos set forth in
determination. He
passed through the
foreboding entrance
and came upon a
crossroads.

Three halls diverged,
marked by troubling,
leering gargoyles. The
left probed deep into
the innermost clutches
of the burly ground.
Page 18: The one ahead
consisted of a
seemingly endless
hallway. The rightmost
path led up a
mesmerizing staircase.

Chaos' keen snout
sensed a moist wind
emanating from the
spiral staircase.
Page 19: Knowing that the
master wizard. Zhalfir
could only exist in a
solid state in sopping
climes, he turned and
began to ascend the
staircase.
Page 20: "Ware the seductions
of Master," the goblin
echoed from behind.
"Even the straightest
arrow can be bent!"

After the warning,
Elliott let loose a
squeal that sounded a
little bit like a fire
hose sprayed through
an electric fan filled
with pelicans and -
Page 21: whistling track
coaches who had a
little too much time on
their hands and liked
to play tug of war
behind the snack
shack but one day the
tennis kids came by
and tipped it over,
subsequently trapping
them in the tomblike
waste wallow and he
hated his life
Page 22: and all the days after
no one looked at him
quite the same way, not
even his family and
that's what Elliott's
scream sounded like.

Chaos ventured
deeper into the
labyrinthine halls. As
he progressed, he
began to fall into
a dreamlike state.
Page 23: The winding corridors
seemed to shift as
inexplicable enigmas
danced within his
primitive manbrain.

His rhythmic footsteps
were punctuated by
mysterious sounds;
sudden soft laughter,
or the quiet shutting
of a door.
Page 24: He felt a singular
sense of disquiet as
he strode ever
quicker down the
corridor, fighting the
trancelike waves of
unreality.

He was suddenly
aware of a vast
presence behind him,
and he whirled
around.
Page 25: Shield set and mace
drawn back, but
nothing was there, and
Chaos began to doubt
his own sanity.

§7(Certainly it wasn't
there in the first
place because he kills
a shit load of innocent
people.)
Page 26: Then a notion arose.
Perhaps Chaos was
not really wandering
the halls, not even
moving. Gods! 

He was wandering
within his own mind! He
must get back to
consciousness right
now, lest he wake up
with a sore ass.
Page 27: He struggled through
the blurring mire of
the dreamworld, trying
to reach out for
consciousness.

Finally, with all of his
will, he snapped back
awake, and found
himself in a dim, velvet
room.
Page 28: His armor covered in
rose petals, but
thankfully still on.

Page 0: Diary of a CASTLEBUILDER!

Day One

It has been very hard. I have already bought all of the sand on the market to use for glass... The floor isn't even HALF DONE!
Page 1: Day Two

Still no sand on the market... And nobody has ten stacks to sell me either. I met a new guy called wario355. He was very useful...
Page 2: Day Three

This is getting interesting, i have found sand and wario355 seems to be trying to get close as if it's some kind of trap...
Page 3: Day Four

As I sit here writing this book, I realise the sand still hasn't cooked... WHAT SORCERY IS THIS!? I do think I may be going crazy...
WHAT IS HAPPENING!?
Although i haven't finished the floor yet, I do quite believe that it shall be finished...
Page 4: Day 4 (Pt. 2)

I am collecting the sand from the furnaces, I don't think i have enough... Only 6 stacks... BAH! Who am I kidding... LET'S DO THIS! Or maybe I should wait until the night is over...


Page 5: Day 4 (Pt. 3)

Now the night is over, I shall finish my castle floor! Yes, I am still on the floor... WOAH! Nearly fell today, and I may have misplaced one glass block, but that does not matter-
Page 6: Ending

-For i have finished!
(Well, at least the floor)

It is time to say farewell, look out for Vol. 2 in a few days, weeks, maybe months, if I get round to it, that is.

Page 3: Prologue
[3 Minutes Before]
 Twas 3 minutes before it all came down. I was sitting on the couch sweat beaten wearing nothing when I heard it coming. It opened the door, and turned out to be Puar. It came with a thrust all over my bust. 
Page 4: [Present]
I saw the Meteor flying down, ready for impact, and knew I had to stop it. I planned slowly and carefully, aligning my mouth perfectly to it. There was sweat on my chin when the red throbbing meteors head landed in my mouth. I knew this would be
Page 5: too much for one person to handle, as it was nearly 4 inches from the ground. The Meteor picked a target of it's taste, a busty tan girl with brown hair, that goes by the name of nrokin. It thrusted back and forth, and I had to act quickly if I wanted to 
Page 6: take down this meteor. I quickly pulled out my tracfone while battling this beast and texted my best friend Vic. You could describe her as very pale, but not as busty, with beautiful hair. She hurried over as fast as she could to help take down this
Page 7: meteor before we could put more people at risk. Victoria and I battled for the head of the meteor, trying our best to take turns, although the meteor kept beating us with it's stick, trying to tell us that it only has a couple of minutes left. That only
Page 8: meant we had to work harder and harder to take it down, and that's when it happened, the meteor exploded into a giant white shower of amazingness all over our faces, and we licked off eachothers faces, spitting it into eachother's mouths. We then finished
Page 9: it off by swallowing. They then spend the next hour or so entertaining themselves in ways TehSabbingSlayer would have enjoyed. They know it won't be the last meteor, so they will always be ready to take down another together, otherwise the whole
Page 10: world is at risk. The tale ends with two bare women feeling accomplishment in their life, very happy with the award they earned. Who knows how many meteors they will have to take on during the weekend...

§0I am Captain_Yaple, Thane of the kingdom of Frostburne. Frostburne has recently secured an alliance with the island nation of Togato, facilitated by it's ambassador, Richiekruger. This alliance has proven beneficial for both 
Page 1: sovreign countries.§0
§0
§0Now with Frostburne's discovery of your castle and lands, I humbly request an audience the next time both of us are online. You will be required to bring a banner symbolizing your nation to be displayed with the rest of the
Page 2: alliance members. §0
§0
§0An alliance would prove beneficial in the way of trade, as well as assistance in the form of manual labor to complete your castle. Not only that, but should military aid be required, the other members of the alliance would be 
Page 3: required to contribute soldiers to defend your lands. 

Please consider the prospect of an alliance generously. We eagerly await your arrival and response!

Yours truly, Captain_Yaple, Thane of Frostburne

Page 0: §9Prologue:

§0Despite the downpour,
Chaos boldy ventured
on into the woeful
valley of
blackened elms.

The sopping sounds of
his splashing feet
echoed into the still,
rain-drenched woods.
Page 1: The burdens he bore
were great, not only
those on his
back, but those of the
heavy toll of sin on
his soul.

Everyone. Not a single
peasant spared. He
mused over his
decision to kill
everyone that looked
like the damned.
Page 2: "Perhaps my judgement
was too harsh. Yes,
that woman really
meant no harm."

He chuckled in
remembrance of the
mass slaughter in the
peaceful hamlet.
Chaos was a hearty
paladin-cow.
Page 3: He didn't stop to think
as he systematically
purged the entire
town.
Penance must be paid

He was on a spiritual
quest to cleanse his
sins he had done in
the company of the
alluring man mage,
Zhalfir.
Page 4: §6Chapter 1

§5-Seven weeks ago, the
hour of the
tendercrisp bacon elf
sandwich.
Page 5: Leaning on the
banister of the
dwarven trade ship,
Chaos saw the Mage's
mighty tower from at
least three fortnight's
walks.

The knight-errant
Chaos had recieved an
ultimatum from the
Dwarven Council.
Page 6: The council were the
rulers of the kingdom
Stoutschmeckle.

Chaos was a simple
man-cow; a mercenary
with a fancy title, and
was by far no means
a hero. He sported a
draping moustache, his
bedraggled hair the
typical burly brown of
his highland homeland.
Page 7: His armor was of
modest leather and
iron, and by chance an
unadorned steel cap
sat atop his head.

No true knight was he.

His equipment
consisted of a sturdy
black mace and a
round shield adorned
with a blue spiral.
Page 8: An ample sack covered
his cape, full of
whimsical odds and
ends necessary for
survival in the world in
which he resided.

The nights were long
and the days were hot,
but in time the sea
voyage met its end.
Page 9: Upon arrival, Chaos
strolled off of the
gangway and onto
solid ground.

The wind whipped up
from the grey ocean
as he beheld the
impressive edifice in
its full glory.
Page 10: Grim clouds slowly
whirled about the top
of the looming
structure, as if by
some...magical force,
perhaps.

He trundled toward
the base of the tower,
and shambled up the
incline to the
entrance.
Page 11: Chaos paused upon
the last step on the
top of the cascading
stairway that led to a
somber, shale door
set in the base of the
stupendous monolith.

A feeling of doubt
washed over him,
quickly being shook
away, knowing he must
press on.
Page 12: He forged his iron will
anew into steel and
reached for the goblin
shaped knocker on the
left of a similar, troll
headed one. 

He recoiled in horror
when the statue's
eyes rolled about
madly.
Page 13: 
"Wahts we got here
Elliott?" the sentient
copper goblin giggled.

"I thinks its fresh
meat for the master."
squealed Elliott the
troll head.
Page 14: Shat-tap, bitch. You
sound like a shrieking
milkmaid who's just
seen a barewolf!
Page 15: "Oh, certainly," replied
the goblin. "But we are
only here to forewarn
the supple fools who
Master lures in.
Secure your ass
plate, noble knight! For
Master desires
manflesh more than
anything these days.

But business is
business, so says I.
Page 16: So enter, but 
remember us well.

For we are the only
pair of knockers you'll
ever see in this tower!
Hee Hee!"

The two copper beings
parted to the sides as
the gates swung
open.
Page 17: Chaos set forth in
determination. He
passed through the
foreboding entrance
and came upon a
crossroads.

Three halls diverged,
marked by troubling,
leering gargoyles. The
left probed deep into
the innermost clutches
of the burly ground.
Page 18: The one ahead
consisted of a
seemingly endless
hallway. The rightmost
path led up a
mesmerizing staircase.

Chaos' keen snout
sensed a moist wind
emanating from the
spiral staircase.
Page 19: Knowing that the
master wizard. Zhalfir
could only exist in a
solid state in sopping
climes, he turned and
began to ascend the
staircase.
Page 20: "Ware the seductions
of Master," the goblin
echoed from behind.
"Even the straightest
arrow can be bent!"

After the warning,
Elliott let loose a
squeal that sounded a
little bit like a fire
hose sprayed through
an electric fan filled
with pelicans and -
Page 21: whistling track
coaches who had a
little too much time on
their hands and liked
to play tug of war
behind the snack
shack but one day the
tennis kids came by
and tipped it over,
subsequently trapping
them in the tomblike
waste wallow and he
hated his life
Page 22: and all the days after
no one looked at him
quite the same way, not
even his family and
that's what Elliott's
scream sounded like.

Chaos ventured
deeper into the
labyrinthine halls. As
he progressed, he
began to fall into
a dreamlike state.
Page 23: The winding corridors
seemed to shift as
inexplicable enigmas
danced within his
primitive manbrain.

His rhythmic footsteps
were punctuated by
mysterious sounds;
sudden soft laughter,
or the quiet shutting
of a door.
Page 24: He felt a singular
sense of disquiet as
he strode ever
quicker down the
corridor, fighting the
trancelike waves of
unreality.

He was suddenly
aware of a vast
presence behind him,
and he whirled
around.
Page 25: Shield set and mace
drawn back, but
nothing was there, and
Chaos began to doubt
his own sanity.

§7(Certainly it wasn't
there in the first
place because he kills
a shit load of innocent
people.)
Page 26: Then a notion arose.
Perhaps Chaos was
not really wandering
the halls, not even
moving. Gods! 

He was wandering
within his own mind! He
must get back to
consciousness right
now, lest he wake up
with a sore ass.
Page 27: He struggled through
the blurring mire of
the dreamworld, trying
to reach out for
consciousness.

Finally, with all of his
will, he snapped back
awake, and found
himself in a dim, velvet
room.
Page 28: His armor covered in
rose petals, but
thankfully still on.

Page 4:      Introduction§0
§0=================== Welcome to potion brewing! If you're new, keep in mind that you need a brewing stand, glass bottles filled with water, and many ingredients, which vary depending on what type of potion you may want to create.
Page 5:      Introduction§0
§0=================== Every brewing stand has the capability to hold at maximum three bottles at a time, meaning you can make 3 potions for every single ingredient you add. Keep this in mind!
Page 6:   Base Ingredients§0
§0=================== These ingredients start all potions.§0
§0------------------- ?Nether Wart§0
§0?Glowstone Dust§0

Page 9:   Effect Corruption§0
§0=================== Fermented Spider Eyes will change a potion's base effect, often reversing it or producing a negative potion. A "corrupted" potion usually does the opposite of the original potion.
Page 10:       Base Potions§0
§0=================== Base potions, much like base ingredients, are the basis of all potions. These are the potions created by simply a watter bottle and a base ingredient together.

Page 0: Yeah, I finally got so bored that I actually began writing. All the servers are getting a bit boring for me, almost all my friends have either quit or gotten banned. I dont have any idea how to make new ones. 
Page 1: Another problem is that I have done evrything; I have a chest full of diamonds and iron, I have a nice home in a little town, I have lots of mums, etc. There is just nothing left to do. I dont know if I should quit.
Page 2: I have considered quiting, for these reasons:§0
§01.I have done everything.§0
§02. I have no friends§0
§03. I have done nothing important.§0
§04. I have lost my original town due to my friends leaving me alone (not because I wanted to leave because I hated it).
Page 3: Anyways that was just me rambling about stuff in this diary-thingy-of sorts.

Page 1: Your death was a cruel one. The master which you were blessed with turned out to be a curse.

It started and ended on the same day.

Once upon a time, two fair horses were given each a golden fruit. Together they gave birth to you.
Page 2: The master was impatient towards the young foal's growth speed. Decreasing the foalhood with bales of hay.

Soon after it was decided that they were going on the journey, they horse obediantly allowed to be ridden on towards the edge of the world.
Page 3: At that edge, the air was tight. Lungs began functioning unappropriately. Ignoring the signs, the master who turned out to be a mistress after closer inspection decided to continue further in.

That was when the death bells began to ring for the horse.
Page 4: An accidentally push led this young horse to his death.

And that young horse was our dear Castle.

You will never be forgotten.

	Title: The 3 Slimes
	Author: shaori0516

Page 0: The Three Little Slimes and the Big Bad Chicken.§0
§0
§0Once Upon a time, there was a player. That player was a good player and voted for a minecraft server called Muttsworld and recieved the reward 'Slimey Surprise'. Using the player's
Page 1: hard earned experience, she used them on name tags and named 3 small slimes so that they would not despawn. This was how the 3 slimes began.§0
§0
§0Their childhood went past like a blur. Buildings and Structures grew and grew around them, visitors and men
Page 2: dressed as cows came and swam in lava.§0
§0
§0They patiently blobbed up and down waiting next to the Christmas tree fountain where bunnies, sheep and chickens decided to live peacefully together. Flowers populated the area and so did the slimes.
Page 3: Slimes were treated as a national symbol, and so they thought it was time they moved out.§0
§0
§0One Slime lived in a hay house, one lived in a stick house while the last one lived in a stone brick building that it had found after a few minutes of traveling.
Page 4: One day, the Chickens decided to rebel against the peace created by the player who spawned the Slimes. And decided to take over.§0
§0
§0There was one chicken. Just one that knew that 3 slimes were no longer in the fenced area the player wanted them to stay in
Page 5: The chicken decided to go on a solo hunt, so that other chickens won't keep telling it to save the slime balls for trampolines and sticky pistons. The chicken wanted Mums. The $$$ and so it travelled down to the stick house to steal the slime balls.
Page 6: The slime noticed the chicken and hid underneath the sticks that it had arranged to look like a house.§0
§0
§0Cluck? The Chicken questioned when the Slime was no where in sight. Noticing that the pile of sticks moved, it came over and furiously pecked it but
Page 7: the sticks were held tightly together by slime.§0
§0
§0Flap, Flap and Flap went the chicken's wings and then blew the Slime's stick structure away into the distance.§0
§0
§0The slime then ran the opposite direction towards the hay home.
Page 8: The second slime quickly invited the first slime in and together they hid from the evil chicken.§0
§0
§0But once again the Chicken flapped it's feathery wings and blew their structure away. Hop, Hop and Hop went the slimes, and they slowly bounced away.
Page 9: They arrived at the player's old castle and found the last slime. Together they hid. No matter how hard the chicken flapped it's wings, the stone bricks would not budge. Then, suddenly the player decided to come in and slice the head and legs of the bird,
Page 10: leaving just a pile of feathers and a chicken breast sitting at the entrance of the mini castle.§0
§0
§0The slimes noticing that the threat is gone, they came out.

Then after devouring the chicken for dinner, they lived...

to jump, to get lost, to get found, to get all

once he stablished near the spawn with machines working 24/7 he expanded with the only purpose to make everything more comfortable

a humble but big house was built with lots of transparent chests with lots of things inside


the wolf was happy, happy to be in his cozy bed once he logged in

Page 0: This will be a long read So, get down and get comfy. All that jazz. So, where do I start? Why did I do this? I have many questions to answer. Hopefully I can get the most of them covered.
Page 1: Let me note. That I didnt want to hurt the players. I planned the attack after a restart so there would be a fairly recent back-up to go from. I still care about you all and I apologize if I disrupted your first day of school or if
Page 2: my decision lead to a bad day. Also behave and be nice to each other and take turns slaughtering each other at /warp fightclub. Be nice to the staff. Try not to get banned.
Page 3: Yelling at mumble about how he runs his server would have done nothing. It would have been useless as it would have gone to the this is how i eat and thats it. Which, I understand, however as much as I understand. I dont support your actions.
Page 4: I doubt there would have been any civil way to address this issue.

I am not that hard to contact, my e-mail is tehsabbingslayer@gmail.com if you wish to remain in contact.

Page 5: RainCake: I know you might not think of me the best right now. Keep drawing!

Anywho. Lets get to business.

§lWhy did I attack muttsworld? Think of it more as me attacking mumble

Page 6: mumblerit has been increasingly abusive to staff and players over the growing months. These people spend their time and money on this server. Much quicker to say fuck you than thank you. He treats staff as if they are throwaways and pretends there are
Page 7: qualified people lining up to help Muttsworld.
The staff spend their time, most dont expect payment or any sort of reward other than the happiness that comes with helping people. Yea, its his business, however treating staff like shit typically ends up

Page 8: with them leaving or slowly becoming bitter towards Muttsworld. He wouldnt have to worry about staff miss-behaving if he actually treated people better.
All this could have been avoided if mumble was a tad nicer and didnt step on people

Page 9: all the damn time. Yes. I know he can do what he wants, however, I was not in support of what he was doing.  In my mind is a bit wrong, unfair, to ban someone for stating their opinion, true or false. The server got to the point where players dont feel
Page 10: safe expressing their opinion or thoughts.
We all know what hes like, we all know what he has been like. You also know what Im like.

*Threatening to ban staff, including myself, and let me note prior to this event.

Page 11: *Banning players because he didnt like what they said, in-game, forums, and because of comments made on Youtube.

*Right now people are purely being banned and/or harassed purely because they associate with me.

Page 12: I completely understand that mumblerit has the right to run Muttsworld the way he chooses. The one thing people often forget about choices is that they often come with consequences. I am also very aware of the many consequences that I will have to deal w.
Page 13: When I was administrator of survival, I cared about my staff and the players. Many of them I considered my friends. I still consider many of those people my friends assuming they wish to remain being friends with me.
Page 14: That was one of the consequences I knew I had to potentially suffer and endure through  because of my attack on Muttsworld.
Also, as an administrator of Muttsworld. If I did what mumble did. I would expect some sort

Page 15: of repercussion. If i treated the players like shit, treated the staff like shit. I wouldnt be an administrator. What sort of example is he setting for his own staff if he goes around acting like a dickbag?
Page 16: Mumble is making it look like I went crazy, yet his actions towards me and the players have lead me to this decision. Hes told staff to mute people who ask any questions about me. Hes trying to convince staff that I went crazy. Mumble knows exactly why
Page 17: I left the server. I gave so many damn warnings about leaving because of his behavior, I was so damn patient. I was attempting to wait for the oh it will get better sort of thing. *shrugs*
Page 18: Mumble is an asshole. No one stands up to him, no one tries to correct his behavior. If you stand up to him, youll get banned. You support his behavior when you play on Muttsworld and buy diplomat and other server perks.
Page 19: The average human life span is 80+ years. I highly doubt you want to be an asshole to people for the remainder of your life. What the fuck burnt you out so much to be a grump? If running the server is putting that much of a strain on you, then idk. Thats
Page 20: your choice and your problem and you need to determine on your own. I hope this is a lesson to treat your damn players and staff members nicer. Yes, xray is a bitch and a box to prevent and to prove. I even know this, Ive run across many mining tunnels o
Page 21: xray, scratching my head and wondering Is this xray?.
tl;dr: Im not giving any of my free-time, regardless of payment, to an asshole. It . Call me old fashioned however I value a thank you more than 2-5 bucks here and there.

Page 22: Im getting pretty tired of typing all of this out. Ill add more as needed. Im pretty sure I went around in circles many times. My past few months on survival made me feel highly unappreciated for the work I did. What do you lose when you tell someone
Page 23: thank you? Do you feel cheesy?  

I would not return to Muttsworld even if I was unbanned. Yes, I am indeed gone from Muttsworld. Ill be on a little server relaxing and chilling. Feel free to e-mail me if you want the IP.

      Muttsworld
         Story



by Sammich98
Page 1:    Once upon a time,
there was a beautiful princess named Sammich. She was only a beautiful princess because her skin was Princess Daisy.
  She had discovered Muttsworld after some time of single player minecraft and played for a while in solitude and 
Page 2: silence. At some point, she got a boyfriend by the name of "mrawesome12345" or something of the likes. Then, after Minecraft dating him for a while he got banned, because his "brother" griefed. She still visited his house at /spawn 4 until it was no 
Page 3: longer a command and she was too lazy to walk from there. Sometime between then and now, she got active in the chat and was very helpful to the many, many noobs of Muttsworld. It was about 5 or 6 months of playing, and she made a staff application to be 
Page 4: an ambassador. That was when only mods and admins could reply to applications and anyone could reply to ban appeals. Sammich got quite positive feedback on the app, with +0.5s and +1s.
  Then.... after a month of the application being there with
Page 5: nothing but positive reviews, she logged on to Muttsworld and a friend said something to her in chat.
"huh?" was about what her reply was.
Then, the realization sunk in. She was an ambassador.



Page 6: Skip forward to April 2013, where she didn't play Minecraft for a month or so and got demoted. She basically didn't play much for a while, until the fall of 2013, when she got re-promoted to ambassador. So then, she played Muttsworld lots and lots
Page 7: as an ambassador, until one day...

Mumblerit needed a shower, but no mods were on to handle modreqs.
"who wants to be a mod?" he had asked
A cry of "me!" was seen in diplochat.
Page 8: "lol" was all the beautiful Princess Sammich said.
"ah, sammich. perfect" was about what mumblerit had said.
So, she was a mod.
  Then, that brings us to where we are now (well, where Sammich is now as she is writing this), which is Sammich floating

Page 1: 9th. I know I should be greatful for this wonderful oppurtunity so I can have a bright future and I really am but I don't get a real break. 28 day plus a couple of extra 3 days every weekend really isn't fair. I want to have a bright future but not all is
Page 2: I am so bored out of my mind and I know I should be reading but then I don't really want to. I want to remain apart of acadamia and highly educated. My life is going awry. I'm only 12 and I have this oppurtunity but I don't know  what I'm gonna do if I
Page 3: don't get accepted into any of the schools. I know I shouldn't worry about my future so much but soon it'll be the end of 8th grade and then i'll have to apply. I hate this so much and I have no faith in myself.
Page 4: Entry #2 §0
§0I am so bored with myslef. I find myself to come off as weird and I don't know what to do. I definitley know I will start my summer project soon but other than that mom doesn't have much time.
Page 5: I make these things sound so fucking dramatic, like what the fuck am i, white. I dont want to go to school and i have to do so many things.
Page 6: September 19th§0
§0
§0I forgot about this. lol. Idk what is my problem, i kind of am attracted to yaismel. It's just a joke, but he is so much more inviting than Allen is.  I joke around about liking him because he is really cool, but i don't really like him,
Page 7: I know for a fact that is I break up with Allen then he will automatically go to someone else, like Marlin or Elizabeth. He'd probably ask why first. He'd say "What did I do wrong this time, I thought we were going great. I really like you." but probably 
Page 8: not. i don't know. I LOVE Allen, and I need to get over Yaismel because we are strictly just friends. I actually have a plan. On Dec. 23 i want to hold mistletoe on top of Allen's head so he can kiss me. Whether it be on the cheek or on the lips.
Page 9: (hopefully not because I don't know how to kiss, lol).
Page 10: Holy fucking shit balls, this book is fucking wacked the fuck out?? I was fucking 12 when I started this piece of trash literature in FUCKING MINECRAFT OF ALL PLACES WHAT THE ACTUAL SHIT. XD I find it so funny how I was talking about Yaismel as if I liked
Page 11: him hahaha that is so fucking hilarious on so many levels. Jeez. I feel so awkward and reading this was so cringeworthy oh my fucking gosh. idk, a boyfriend is the least of my "everlasting list of problems" since obviously I am fucking miserable as all 
Page 12: hell, right? (sarcasm is over 9000 btw) Anyways, this book is fucking trash. End. Of. Fucking. Story.
Page 13: August 26th 2016§0
§0
§0lmao what the fuck actually is this book like??? I don't know when i felt the need to vent to a fucking fake diary in minecraft... I like how in the last entry I was like "oh this was so cringeworthy im a fucking loser" when the last
Page 14: entry was just as cringey jfc. okay but this book is actually pathetic like um gtg! in reference to that shit i made when i was just entering eighth grade (dear god) i got into a specialized high school so lmao suck my ass past me. okay no but forreal im 
Page 15: ACTUALLY a fucking loser. like i really hate myself and idk i have no interests or anything smh?? it's hard for me to make friends because im socially inept lol. idk in summary i really just feel like dying at times but then im like "lmao suicide would 
Page 16: hurt real fuckin bad prob shouldn't do that haha whoops. like i don't really have a reason to kill myself like my life is fine and boring and shit i just feel efgy sometimes like i could be doing something with my life but at the same time lmao no who tf 
Page 17: am i i dont even go outside so nah. anyways im writing this for future reference like if i ever come here again ( i doubt that I will bc adan and i don't talk to each other?? and hes a fuckin mess??) but yeah this was contradictory and cringey like always

For this job, you will need to collect resourses for me and bring them to me so I can sell them. You will get a 40% cut off all money earned for the things you brought me to sell. I will pay you at the end of each week (Friday). 
Page 1: Every moday there will be a new book at your base telling you what i need farmed and aproximatly how much i will need. Saturdays and Sundays are days off. You can still collect resourses on the weekends but I will not take them until a buisiness day.
Page 2: (Monday-Friday) 
Any resourses that are not sold will either be given back to you or kept if you do not want them back. If at one week yor pay is a bit smaller than usual it is because nit as much of your item was sold that week, do not complain because I
Page 3: can not do anything about it. 
There is oportunity to rise up to become a manager and what not, but you must show great skill and know-how. 

Page 4: With all of this in mind, good luck to you at Brick Industries. I am looking forward to working with you. Your first order book will be at your base tomorrow.

Page 0: I went to Disney World Magic Kingdom today wearing this pink and white sun dress and my hair was in soft curls. My hair is sort of long.Anyway, we were walking around for a little while, and then this mother walked up to me holding her daughters hand. 
Page 1: At first I kind of got nervous because I dont just get randomly talked to on the norm. But then the mother kind of embarrassingly said I dont mean to bother you dear, but my daughter here has been asking me non stop since shes seen you if you were the
Page 2: you were Sleeping Beauty and if its your day off.

Ok, now I do not look like any Disney Princess. So I assumed she only thought this because of my hair and dress (I would imagine if Sleeping Beauty were walking around Disney in the summertime on her
Page 3: day off she would wear a pink sun dress. Or blue lol).I looked down at the daughter, who was wearing a Sleeping Beauty kids dress and she was kind of hiding behind her mom and smiling. So instead of telling her no, this is what I did: I bent down on my 
Page 4:  knees so I could be on her level and I said, Oh Princess, you must have just woken up for behaving so silly. Obviously you are Princess Aurora, arent you? I pointed to her dress. It really is an honor to meet you. You're my favorite Disney Princess."
Page 5: By now she was giggling and moving out from behind her mom. But I have to warn you. I heard that an evil sorceress is out to get you, so be careful. Make sure you be safe and stay away from spinning wheels! I looked up at the girls  mother who had the 
Page 6: biggest smile on her face. Ok Princess, you better get back to running the kingdom. And remember to always keep dreaming! The girl then gave me a hug. When they were walking away the mother turned back to me and I noticed her eyes were watery. She 
Page 7: mouthed, "thank you".

And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the best story I have heard.

 I've meet Briana shes a very cool person and pretty funny. But its hard, guess I'm not
if she/he is a girl. I dont want to go through the same thing again and get trolled.

I fancy her, I like her very much. As she descriped herself 
Page 1: she looked pretty fine. She left her diary in a open chest. Where it said she liked me, and would go out with me. 
She proably did so I would find. Guess who would put a chest with no sign on when its private. Anyway me head is hurting when thinking if 
Page 2: shes a real girl or just a troll. I hope shes a real girl. But I never be sure.


And you reading this
found this. If its Briana. This is all true. I kind of want to get together. But its hard I'm 13 and your 11 and we live in diffrent 
Page 3: continents, I will hide this book in a chest 
with no sign. So destiny will choice if she finds the book and read after that is unknown.

Page 0: The Waste Land

by  TS Eliot


April is the cruellest month, breeding lilacs out of the dead land, mixing memory and desire, stirring dull roots with spring rain.  Winter kept us warm, covering earth in 
Page 1: forgetful snow, feeding a little life with dried tubers.  Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee with a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade, and went on in the sunlight, into the Hofgarten, and drank coffee, and talked for an hour. 
Page 2: And when we were children, staying at the archduke's, my cousin's, he took me out on a sled, and I was frightened.  He said, Marie, Marie, hold on tight.  And down we went.  In the mountains, there you feel free. I read, much of the night, and go south in
Page 3: the winter.

What are the roots that clutch, what branches grow out of this stony rubbish?  Son of man, you cannot say, or guess, for you know only a heap of broken images, where the sun beats, and the dead tree gives no shelter, the 
Page 4: cricket no relief, and the dry stone no sound of water.  Only there is a shadow under this red rock (come in under the shadow of this red rock), and I will show you something different from either your shadow in the morning striding behind you or your
Page 5: shadow at evening rising to meet you; I will show you fear in a handful of dust.

"You gave me hyacinths first a year ago; they called me the hyacinth girl." -- Yet when we came back, late, from the Hyacinth garden, your arms full, and your hair wet, I 
Page 6: could not speak, and my eyes failed, I was neither living nor dead, and I knew nothing, looking into the heart of the light, the silence.

Page 4:      Introduction§0
§0=================== Welcome to potion brewing! If you're new, keep in mind that you need a brewing stand, glass bottles filled with water, and many ingredients, which vary depending on what type of potion you may want to create.
Page 5:      Introduction§0
§0=================== Every brewing stand has the capability to hold at maximum three bottles at a time, meaning you can make 3 potions for every single ingredient you add. Keep this in mind!
Page 6:   Base Ingredients§0
§0=================== These ingredients start all potions.§0
§0------------------- ?Nether Wart§0
§0?Glowstone Dust§0
§0?Redstone§0
§0?Fermented Spider Eye [Adding these to a water bottle will create a base potion. see page 11]

§0?Fermented Spider Eye§0
§0[See next page]
Page 9:   Effect Corruption§0
§0=================== Fermented Spider Eyes will change a potion's base effect, often reversing it or producing a negative potion. A "corrupted" potion usually does the opposite of the original potion.
Page 10:       Base Potions§0
§0=================== Base potions, much like base ingredients, are the basis of all potions. These are the potions created by simply a watter bottle and a base ingredient together.

A non-fictional book about all the love and sexual relationships over MuttsWorldMine.


Please do not read further, if your under 18 years of age.

Chapter 4
Current Situation
Page 2: The Beginning:

Mumblerit set up a minecraft server. He put adds on several websites to attract more people. Soon the community began to bloom and the first romances began to blossom. The coming of Novra and her twin Trezi, was the first
Page 3: female visitor and gentleman as Mumblerit was. He introduced himself to them. They began long and complicated discussions about the future of MuttsWorldMine and before long Mumblerit was smitten by Novra's uncanny charms. Out of this relationship
Page 4: Novra's adminpower was born. The days followed and it became more busy and busy. Trezi became envious of the power Novra had. She decided to approach Mumblerit on the sexual front, by challenging him into perverted webcam things that shall cannot be 
Page 5: disclosed in this book. Shortly after she found herself on the moderator list. This struck the beginning of moderator relationships. 

Page 6: The Mods

One of the most memorable times was the time Zhalfir got named mod. Zhalfir quickly grew to be notorious until he found Katie. Katie was a regular and later a diplo. By the time she became diplo, the relationship had
Page 7: flourished to a wonderful sexual adventure. This was one of the most frowned upon relationships. Especially cause Katie because of her young age was not allowed to be a moderator aswell.
Page 8: BigNatDaddy was later announced to be a moderator. He fell in love with a lovely girl AkinaWolf. Much to BlueDragon's envi, BigNat put all his love and affection in Akina. This is how the odd relationship between Akina and Blue started. 
Page 9: The Unfolding

Novra and Mumblerit, were judged by many which caused their relationship to become stale and business-related. This was the time Trezi made the Admin ranks. 

Zhalfir and Katie had many relational
Page 10: battles, over TeamSpeak and the global chat of MuttsWorldMine. It became appearant that the sexual adventures seemed to reach no end on the webcam, until everything was against them and the relationship collapsed into itself. The shakey grounds Zhalfir
Page 11: walked on were about to go KABOOM! This was when Katie broke of the relationship in tears and both of them have never been seen since. Rumors have spread about Zhalfir daily masturbating to 1000's of pictures he has of Katie. Other rumors about Katie
Page 12: ranged from suicide to finding a different love in her life, which caused her to drop Minecraft completely. Thus shutting out the emberassing things that have happened.

BigNatDaddy and AkinaWolf went by quietly. From love to sex to break up. All
Page 13: were done in the fullest of their own privacy. Cause of all the other drama with Zhalfir this relationship has never been properly investigated.
Page 14: Current situation

Novra has left. 
Trezi has left.

Mumblerit's power was absolute until his hearth fell for Tobo. Many hours the chatted and cammed. Hours of sexual tension and relational comments were
Page 15: exchanged. Causing a mediocre woman by the name Tobo to join the admin ranks. The old days of Novra are sorrily missed till this very day. 

Zhalfir and Katie were never to be heard of again.


Page 16: BigNat and Akina, although broken up come by every so often. 

This became the ending of durable relationships on MuttsWorldMine. Many players have tried several types of relationships. All of them have failed.
Page 17: I think what you should know is never to date a fellow MineCrafter. Unless you already know this MineCrafter in real life, before you started playing. The relationship will surely not survive. That first impression is that your a blockhead anyways.
Page 18: On this positive outlook and attitude I end this book. May it be read by few and celebrated by many. 

- THE END -

Page 1: I Pass Out At a Party

Mom was ecstatic.

"My little Jaxson's growing up"she sobbed as i hung bright blue streamers from our apartment ceiling."Mom its just a party" i replied smiling "Dont worry."
Mom sighed "Ok baby but first, What do you
Page 2: do if there are monsters?"I sighed,this was getting annoying."i get everyone to Camp and contact Chiron"I said for the millionth time.
"Good,have fun baby"she said as she shut the door behind her.
After all the preparations had been
set,i waited anxiousl
Page 3: for my friends.The door rang and i wiped my sweaty palms on my jeans.Emma came through the door first,pecking me on the cheek as she went by.I blushed.Then Katie came,then Nathan,and the last one to caome in was Jason.
"Ok everybody,"I began,turning to
Page 4: the mob of demigods before me.Suddenly our apartment seemed really small."I just wanted to say that-"
"No need to give us the whole monologue Kelp Head,"Emma rolled her eyes,"Were all just happy to get out of Camp for a little while."
LETS GET THIS PARTY
Page 5: STARTED!"Katie yelled before running over to our stereo to crank up some hevay metal rock music.
"OH NO WAY ARE WE LISTENING TO THIS!"yelled Emma,stomping over to Katie."KATY PERRY ALL THE WAY!"
I decided not to ponder Emma's song choice,and looked at 
Page 6: the scene around me.The party was going well.Nathan and Jason stood in a corner talking to a dead ghost that Nathan had conjured who looked suspiciously like Abraham Lincon.Emma
sat at a table cheerfully blabbing to Katie about a ancient monument in Egyp
Page 7: while she stared at me looking like she was dying.Then the doorbell rang for pizzas.I paid the gangly,acne coverd the delivery man and slammed the door in his face before he could finish saying,"Hey is that Abraham Linc-"


Page 8: Then all at once,I felt sick.

My head pounded and the world swirled around me in multi-colored hues.I dropped the pizza in suprise.
"Jaxson are you alright?"Emma asked sounding worried.
"Yeah, I just need a glass of water,"I 
Page 9: slurred before the ground spun up to meet me.
I blinked my eyes drearily on the floor,and saw blurred faces above me.The last thing I think before i descended into darkness was Emma's warm hands urgently shaking my shoulders.
Page 10: Hope you like it tell me if you did cause there is more.I didnt do anymore cause i didnt know if you liked it or not.

§0A death cry like, "ARRRRRRRRGGGGGGG!" posted ONE time in chat is not spam worth your time. This can cause players to dislike you.§0

§0When dealing with players who spam give them a few warning first about 3-5 depending on what they di

§0If someone goes §0
§0"LORD you killed me animals" it's not so bad

§0
§0Players bypassing word filters is another§0
§0thing to look out for. Players find creative ways to bypass 
Page 6: the chat filters like  sh*t or any number of other tricks. A warning or two followed by a mute is a easy way to get the point across that this is not tolerated. If there's a roleplay going on there's no need to pull them up on every little caps they do.

	Author: DiabloBlade

Page 0: Lockette and the Wolf, part 1

"How did they meet?"

Chapter 1: I kissed a girl?! This story starts in a Muttsworldbar. Lockette walks in the bar looking for a fun night out and flirting with guys. She is wearing a short skirt 
Page 1: and tights. As Lockette walks by the bar she sees a mysterious person sitting lonely in the corner of the bar. Lockette didn't recognize the person because the mysterious person was wearing a wolf pelt covering part of it' face and body. As it happened to
Page 2: be the person under the wolf pelt is Wolf, hiding for moderators who tried to kill her yesterday for some reason. Lockette was attracted by the mysterious appearance and decided to get her flirt on. As Lockette flirted she didn't seem to recognize it was
Page 3: Wolf nor that she is flirting with a woman.
After an hour of flirting Wolf made her move and said: "How about you and me, in that bathroom?" Lockette was a little shocked and thought to herself: "well Royal can't satisfied me, what the hell we only live 
Page 4: once"thinking she was going to get laid by a boy Lockette agreed. After Wolf gave Lockette a tongue kiss they walked to the woman's bathroom.

chapter 2: Surprise! I do got balls

After they got into the bathroom, Lockette
Page 5: locked the door and starts to kiss Wolf. Not breaking the kiss, Wolf slowly pushes Lockette into the wall. With no way out Lockette gets undressed by wolf. After taking Lockette's shirt and bra off, it was Wolf's time to get some undress by Lockette. As
Page 6: Lockette removed the wolf pelt she was shocked. It wasn't a man naked under the wolf pelt, but a female! Lockette was disappointed and told Wolf she wanted a real man to fuck her not a woman. Disappointed wolf looked away for a second and notice a small 
Page 7: hole in the wall. As she looked through the hole, she could see a part of someones face. She recognized the face, it was Echo the moderator who triend to burn the book that she was writing about DiabloBlade. Wolf spends lots of time writing about 
Page 8: DiabloBlade's amazing penis and gets wet as she thinks about it. But now she didn't have time to think about DiabloBlade's cock as she saw a great chance to get revenge on Echo and proof that she can be above any man. Wolf signed Echo to put his penis 
Page 9: through the hole. As horny as Echo was he put his penis through the hole. Suddenly Wolf got her wooden sword and cut Echo's penis clear off with great ease. It was easy to do with a wooden sword, because Echo' penis wasn't big at all. As Echo was
Page 10: Screaming from the pain, Wolf yells: "How about that for payback? bitch!!!" Wolf picked up the cut off penis and flush it down the toilet as she yells: "Who's the man now?!" Echo ran out of the bar crying. Lockette was so amazed at this experience she 
Page 11: gave the lesbian experience a change.

chapter 3: I fucked a girl and i loved it!

Lockette's still only wearing her skirt and agreed to the lesbian experience. She walked to Wolf and gave her a tongue kiss lasting for at least a minute. Wolf
Page 12: was surprised by Lockette' reaction and told Lockette to lean forward and put her hands òn the wall. Lockette felt exposed and arched het back slightly, tempting Wolf to touch het body. Slowly Wolf removed the tiny skirt covering Lockette's lower parts.
Page 13: All that's between Lockette and Wolf now is the thin little black strip of Lockette's panties. Lockette found herself hoping Wolf would pull them off before she gets them too wet to wear. Wolf hooked her nails into the panties at the hips and pulls them 
Page 14: down. Lockette' legs are parted enough that they only get halfway down her thighs before they pull tight. Lockette arches het back further, pushing her ass out towards Wolf saying: "i want you to touch me, i want your fingers on me, i want your mouth on
Page 15: me. Anything. I just want you touching me. My naked pussy is right in front of you and i can feel you breathing." While she said that Lockette was wondering if Wolf was touching herself. The thought of this made Lockette even hornier. She imagines Wolf
Page 16: standig behind her with her finger rubbing her pussy while she watches all that is exposed in front of her. then Wolf touches Lockette` Her hand feels up between Lockette's legs with a form confidence that made Lockette gasp (sound effect). Suddenly Wolf
Page 17: presses her finger into Lockette and Lockette push back against Wolf's hand. Wolf is ruthless. She pushes her finger straight in as deep and far as her finger could reach and Lockette finds herself gasping and couldn't even cry out (sound effect). Then 
Page 18: Wolf fucked Lockette with her hand.
Two fingers thrust in and out so quickly that Lockette could feel her heels skimming on the floor. Lockette lowered her head and pushed her arms against the wall, curling on her toes just hoping she wouldn't fall. Wolf
Page 19: shoved her hand in harder, fucking Lockette so rough, that her hand slaps on Lockette's ass with each thrust. Lockette's legs are trembling and she can hear her heels tapping irregularly on the floor like drums by drummer on drugs. Lockette leans
Page 20: further forward, her forearms resting vertically on the wall, het elbows banging against the wall. Lockette can't help, but let out a little noise. Lockette thought it would be a moan but it turned out to be more like a growl once it escaped her
Page 21: throat (sound effect). Wolf pushes her thumb between the cheeks of Lockette's ass and rock hard against her like she is trying to lift her off her feet using het pussy as a handhold. Wolf puts the fingers of her other hand right on Lockette's clit. The 
Page 22: fingers in Lockette's pussy suddenly hooked up towards her stomach. Lockette wanted to cum so badly. She wanted it so bad that she can't even form the words to tell Wolf.Lockette's hands are grabbing aimlessly against the wall and her legs are shaking.
Page 23: Lockette thought she might fall. She might just topple down against the toilet.
She continues thinking: "Would you lean down and continue to fuck me if i fell? i can't take the risk, i want to cim so bad". Lockette wanted to take a hand off the wall so 
Page 24: she could grab her breasts and press them hard agaunst her ribs. The orgasm hit Lockette like an atom bomb (sound effect), a deep hot glow that spread and almost consumed her whole body in flame. Lockette felt like a shell of render skin, around a
Page 25: fireball that threatened to consume her. Wolf must of have felt Lockette cumming, because she stopped thrusting and pressed her hand firmly against lockette, holding her steady while she orgasm. Lockette's legs are so shaky that she has to remain leaning 
Page 26: on the wall even after Wolf withdrew her hands. After a few moments of catching her breath and balance she manages to stand up. Lockette can feel her cheeks flushed, throat sweet and she's sure that she is glowing cherry red. Lockette turned to face Wolf
Page 27: and Wolf pressed her wet fingers against Lockette's lips. Lockette kissed them and take them into her mouth. She could taste her own pussy on Wolf' fingers. Lockette's breathing is still unsteady (sound effect), Lockette's lips trembled against Wolf's 
Page 28: hand. Wolf licked her lips and smiled. Lockette wanted to kiss Wolf but she didn't trust herself to mave just yet.
Lockette cleaned herself up a but, before pulling her wet panties up. Lockette goes to the wash basin and splashes a little water on her 
Page 29: face and fixes her hair. Afterwhich Lockette and Wolf got dressed. Before Lockette left through the door, Wolf kissed her and said "next time you may satisfy me" and gave Lockette a card with her number. Wolf left the bathroom and the bar. About 5 minutes
Page 30: Lockette also left the bathroom and the bar.
While Lockette was typing "/home" she thought to herself: "How to pay Wolf back for making me so exposed".

Page 4:      Introduction
=================== Welcome to potion brewing! If you're new, keep in mind that you need a brewing stand, glass bottles filled with water, and many ingredients, which vary depending on what type of potion you may want to create.
Page 5:      Introduction
=================== Every brewing stand has the capability to hold at maximum three bottles at a time, meaning you can make 3 potions for every single ingredient you add. Keep this in mind!
Page 6:   Base Ingredients
=================== These ingredients start all potions.
------------------- ?Nether Wart
?Glowstone Dust
?Redstone
?Fermented Spider Eye [Adding these to a water bottle will create a base potion. see page 11]

Page 9: Day 4§0
§0
§0Dear Diary,§0
§0
§0Ahh... rain. Somtimes i like it, sometimes i freaking HATE IT. I like it when its at night, so you can just sleep it off... but in the day, Yuck! Its just horrible to do anything when its raining in the day. And not just that,
Page 10: rain in the day on minecraft makes me just want to go outside. But outside? Really? Uhh... no.§0
§0Anyways, enough about my minecraft rain rant, lets go onto whats happening right now.§0
§0So there are about 20 chickens in my house right now... I'm not sure 
Page 11: why... but I think someone is either messing with me or chickens just spawn when im around. I had to round em all up accept for my first chicken pet. Im still not sure what to name her, so i think im going to ask around. after getting all the other 
Page 12: chickens in the pen, i butcher a few of them for food. ITS THE CIRCLE OF LIFE GEEZE. After cooking the meat, I hide it from my pet chicken so she cant see her brotheren cooked. Ugh, so morbid. But a girls gotta do what a girls gotta do, am I right? Oh 
Page 13: crap, my chicken escaped. I go and get my chicken when I see that the raid is gone. Fudge off, rain. Just fudge off. After getting my chicken back, I think about asking around for a name for her tomorow... then sundown is appon us. I head to bed awaiting 
Page 14: the next day.
Page 15: Day 5§0
§0
§0Dear Diary,§0
§0 §0
§0  After a LONG day yesterday, i am going to ask around for names for my chicken.§0
§0After asking around for a while, I come across a beautiful name, Lucky Clucky.
Page 16: So, i have decided to name my amazing chicken, Lucky Clucky. 
Page 17: Day 6§0
§0
§0Dear Diary,§0
§0
§0  I have started off the day with clearing some land. It helps me get calm. While doing it, in the chat it said that a infernal squid spawned near me! Imedeatly, i set off to find it and kill it. But while trying to find
Page 18: it, the server glitches and I got kicked off. Tryed to log back on for the first time, said unknowen host. But I tried a second time and it worked. But by that time it was night, so I went to bed. I greeted Lucky CLucky and i fell right asleep. Then, 
Page 19: somthing awakens me. A thing in the chat that says "Somthing is comming..." So i look outside and i see nothing but 2 villager zombies. Then Lucky Clucky thinks its a good time to run outside. I kill the zombies then look around more.

Page 4:      Introduction§0
§0=================== Welcome to potion brewing! If you're new, keep in mind that you need a brewing stand, glass bottles filled with water, and many ingredients, which vary depending on what type of potion you may want to create.
Page 5:      Introduction§0
§0=================== Every brewing stand has the capability to hold at maximum three bottles at a time, meaning you can make 3 potions for every single ingredient you add. Keep this in mind!
Page 6:   Base Ingredients§0
§0=================== These ingredients start all potions.§0
§0------------------- ?Nether Wart§0
§0?Glowstone Dust§0
§0?Redstone§0
§0?Fermented Spider Eye [Adding these to a water bottle will create a base potion. see page 11]

Page 9:   Effect Corruption§0
§0=================== Fermented Spider Eyes will change a potion's base effect, often reversing it or producing a negative potion. A "corrupted" potion usually does the opposite of the original potion.
Page 10:       Base Potions§0
§0=================== Base potions, much like base ingredients, are the basis of all potions. These are the potions created by simply a watter bottle and a base ingredient together.

Page 1: 
   CHAPTER ONE
===================It was a cold day. I warmed my gloves by the fire, hoping that perhaps we'd have an extra set of rations tonight. This was a fool's dream, however, and we all knew it.
Page 2: Despite the brutal conditions and heavy casualties, things were starting to look up. We were quick to relax, as we'd been fighting all through the day. Tjaden suffered a cut to the thigh, seemingly caused by a serrated edge.
Page 3: We cringed at the thought of the wound, as Tjaden slept on one of the only three straw beds we had available for the wounded. The rest of us made camp on the floor. Before drifting to sleep, I began thinking of home.
Page 4: This was a mistake of course, as no soldier should ever dream of home, with its high-rolling green meadows, of its warm breeze against their skin. And especially a soldier should never dream of his parents.
Page 5: It's often good to think of home, but never to create such brittle fantasies, such thin memories, as gentle as a spiderweb. It seemed so foreign to me, it's been 3 years since I slept in my own bed, at home.
Page 6: I often missed my dreary existance in civilian life, but I had grown old in the war, despite my young age. 

It was a glorious day, when we signed up...

What sweet memories that made...
Page 7: 
   CHAPTER TWO
===================I had made haste that morning. I had a usual routine of groggily walking down the stairs around noon, when the sun was high in the sky, still rubbing sleep out of my eyes. Today was different.
Page 8: I awoke at approximately 8:00 sharp, readied myself for the day and set off at 8:30. I can remember it so clearly, yet anything else is fogged, as if someone is heavily breathing on the glass of my mind.
Page 9: I met with my friends from school, readying myself for the careful examination of the combat teacher. Tjaden stood at full attention, as if he was born for no reason other than to battle. Bäumer stood at his best ready position, also, but it was apparent 
Page 10: that he was not yet trained. Pünkte and the other recrutes stood on their best behavior, ready for training. I, however did not want to join the military, and it apparently showed.
Page 11: "Hold fast, recruit! What is your name?"
"Friedrich" I replied sheepishly. I had not anticipated to be called out in this manner. 
"And what is your last name? The one that matters."
"Uh... Gärtner, sir!"
Page 12: "And why was your reply late, may I ask? Is this truly your name?" He asked, obviously toying with me.
"Yes, sir!" I replied, embarrassed. He barked at a few of the recruits in an aggressive tone, but after 3 or 4 of us, he gave up.
Page 13: After hours of physical training and marching-drills, we finally got our rest. It was good, there was plenty of food and beer, and everyone was in a jolly mood, having made it past basic selection.
Page 14: 
 CHAPTER THREE
===================We awoke early for the next 2 months. The same cycle every day. Wake up before dawn had even broken, run drills for 6 hours, eat, and rest soon afterwards.
Page 15: This continued for nearly half a year, with small breaks in between for Christmas and other holidays. It was not so bad, we were only a village away from my home, so on holidays, I would return to visit my family.
Page 16: Eventually the day came. We were given our field-kits. A cheaply-made iron chestplate which made an amusing *klang!* noise when we jumped, a sturdy set of boots, and a tought set of leather pants.
Page 17: The boots were not so bad, in fact they were quite comfortable to wear around the base camp. The chestplates were clearly made on a whim, by some Bavarian factory-worker looking for a quick buck. They'd stop nothing more than a stick.
Page 18: The leggings were the worst of all. It seemed half of our had come from the frontlines, pulled off of dead soldiers. Bäumer's had a clear cut through the knee-cap, with a suspiciously crimson-red stained left leg. We soon decided that it was clearly not
Page 19: a jelly-stain, as the commander had stated. We had to undergo more training while wearing our field-gear and fencing with wooden swords. Two days after recieving our 'armor', our swords arrived.
Page 20: Tjaden was for once the luckiest of the group. His sword was a finely attuned, Swedish made blade. If you had told us that it was forged yesterday, we all well would have believed it. My blade looked worn and used. It was chipped heavily about the
Page 21: hand-guard and lower blade section. A few men traded blades, though it wouldn't matter much. It was based on opinion. We were told that we would move out in 3 days. Of course, when we heard this, we all left soon afterwards to say goodbye to our friends.
Page 22: 
  CHAPTER FOUR
=================== The day had come. We arose at 6:30, the commander was generous enough to give us a half hour's more sleep.
Page 23: I grabbed my pack, and we were rationed loaves of bread and tough sausages of pork. We polished off our sausages and saved the bread for later. Most of us, at least.
Page 24: As we were walking, our breast-plates clanking amidst our marching, our mis-matched swords strewn carefully in the sheathes of those fortunate enough to have one on their battle-worn leggings, it became apparent that we were not well prepared.
Page 25: It seemed as though every day, more and more countries joined in on the meaningless war, and that we were the least prepared of all of them. We were told to set up our camp around an open field, amidst a forest. We managed to do so by about sunset.
Page 26: We finished what little stale bread we had, passing our spare to those who had not been so careful with their rations. As I looked around, passing the heel of my loaf to another soldier, I realized that we may have been ill-prepared, but what we lacked
Page 27: in individual equipment, we made up for in numbers. We were only one regiment of the 20 sent onto the field in the past week, and us alone was 120 men strong. This reasurred me, but it was tough to sleep. We were told of an ambush from the
Page 28: French coming tomorrow. We acted to one another as if there would be no such ambush, but inside, we all knew what would meet us in the morning.
Page 29: 
  CHAPTER FIVE
=================== We awoke earlier than usual, likely before 5:00 even. It was dark as the night we struggled to sleep in previously.
Page 30: We all looked around, trying to let our eyes adjust. Pünkte came prepared, however. He pulled a torch and a fire-starting kit from his knapsack. He lit the torch, and it went up like a tiny volcano on the end of a stick. We covered our eyes for a few
Page 31: seconds, as it was very bright. 
"You there!" Hollered the commander
"Snuff that torch! Do you want them to all know where we are?"
Cursing under his breath, he quickly extinguished the torch in the mud laid below our tent.
Page 32: We sat in silence for quite some time. We could almost see the sun coming up when we hear the yelling of what sounded like 1,000 men. They trampled the ground, and made us tremble.
Page 33: In the cover of darkness, they ran for us, and it was evident as to why they were so loud. Many of them rode on horses, firing arrows towards us at high velocity.
Page 34: A few of our men charged forward, but it was no use; they were quickly struck down by the better-equipped French cavalry. Many of us stood in place, wide-eyed at what was happening, forgetful to what had been mentioned the night before.
Page 35: "Hold your ground!" Yelled our commander. "Let them move to us!" Hollered a recruit from another section of our regiment, whose voice I recognized not. 
Page 36: The French continued their rush towards us, yelling the whole way, and it felt as though time itself came to a halt. We still stood in awe until a French swordsman got close enough to be beheaded by a sergeant from our regiment.
Page 37: We had heard nothing but stories of courage about the war. Nothing but knights in their shining armor, bucking their horse as its mane fluttered in the wind. This was nonsense. When someone is put in a position we were all facing,
Page 38: all emotion is lost. Everything we had trained and trained for had been forgotten. We fought only for ourselves. From the air it must have looked like someone tried to merge oil and water, clear-cut line drawing its way down the battlefield.
Page 39: It continued for long into the afternoon. Five of us stuck together in a group amidst the chaos of the combat. Bäumer, Tjaden, Pünkte and I stood in a close formation, along with another man whose name we did not know.
Page 40: A few squads came rushing towards us, and Tjaden was the first to strike. His blade dug into a man's midriff, and was stuck in his shoulder. I was watching until I was hit across the face with the hilt of a dagger. Bäumer grabbed the man's arm and forced 
Page 41: him to stab himself with his own dagger. I finally snapped out of my shell-shocked surprise, and realised what was happening. Three more men came towards us. I swung at one, but he was quick. He jumped backwards, but unfortunately for him, his friend was
Page 42: close beside with a lashing strike, which dug into his side. He fell with a yelp, his friend's sword buried in him. I was quick on the draw, and swung from the top downward onto the now weaponless man. He tried to dodge, and I hit him in the shoulder. 
Page 43: His arm came clean off, and blood spurted like water from a pump. It was gruesome, but at the time I was fighting for one reason and one reason only: survival. I swung sideways, decapitating him. His head rolled to the floor, as another lunged at me.
Page 44: I barely managed to raise my sword in time to parry his strike, and it was barely effective, to say the least. He stumbled backwards, into Pünkte, who gladly finished him off with a cut to the throat. This type of horrible warfare continued until late in 
Page 45: the evening. At that point, we had all been scattered across the field, finishing off the last of the French with our heavy broadswords. Their cutlasses were no match in an open environment.
Page 46: I hit a man backwards, and he fell under an injured horse. He was trampled in front of my eyes, and I fought the urge to throw up. I turned and looked at the field, now soaked thoroughly in blood. Our band of friends gathered quickly afterwards, stepping
Page 47: over the disfigured corpses. Bäumer had taken a cut to the left arm, one he would live through with no problem. Tjaden and I remained unscathed, at least physically. Pünkte had not been so fortunate. He lay with his eyes open, unblinking, soaked in a pool
Page 48: of his own blood. Many men lay about us in the same fashion, both French and German, but the sight of a dear friend in such a condition was heart-wrenching. Soon afterwards, the commander requested each squad leader take a head-count and report to him.
Page 49: We would have done so, had our leader not been dead. We tallied our squad. What was once 12 men was now a sorry group of 5. The commander came soon with the total. What was once 120 men was now 70. It was not a good day.

	Title: Cow's Tale: Ch1
	Author: XxChaosIncxX
	Type: Written

Page 0: §9Prologue:

§0Despite the downpour,
Chaos boldy ventured
on into the woeful
valley of
blackened elms.

The sopping sounds of
his splashing feet
echoed into the still,
rain-drenched woods.
Page 1: The burdens he bore
were great, not only
those on his
back, but those of the
heavy toll of sin on
his soul.

Everyone. Not a single
peasant spared. He
mused over his
decision to kill
everyone that looked
like the damned.
Page 2: "Perhaps my judgement
was too harsh. Yes,
that woman really
meant no harm."

He chuckled in
remembrance of the
mass slaughter in the
peaceful hamlet.
Chaos was a hearty
paladin-cow.
Page 3: He didn't stop to think
as he systematically
purged the entire
town.
Penance must be paid

He was on a spiritual
quest to cleanse his
sins he had done in
the company of the
alluring man mage,
Zhalfir.
Page 4: §6Chapter 1

§5-Seven weeks ago, the
hour of the
tendercrisp bacon elf
sandwich.
Page 5: Leaning on the
banister of the
dwarven trade ship,
Chaos saw the Mage's
mighty tower from at
least three fortnight's
walks.

The knight-errant
Chaos had recieved an
ultimatum from the
Dwarven Council.
Page 6: The council were the
rulers of the kingdom
Stoutschmeckle.

Chaos was a simple
man-cow; a mercenary
with a fancy title, and
was by far no means
a hero. He sported a
draping moustache, his
bedraggled hair the
typical burly brown of
his highland homeland.
Page 7: His armor was of
modest leather and
iron, and by chance an
unadorned steel cap
sat atop his head.

No true knight was he.

His equipment
consisted of a sturdy
black mace and a
round shield adorned
with a blue spiral.
Page 8: An ample sack covered
his cape, full of
whimsical odds and
ends necessary for
survival in the world in
which he resided.

The nights were long
and the days were hot,
but in time the sea
voyage met its end.
Page 9: Upon arrival, Chaos
strolled off of the
gangway and onto
solid ground.

The wind whipped up
from the grey ocean
as he beheld the
impressive edifice in
its full glory.
Page 10: Grim clouds slowly
whirled about the top
of the looming
structure, as if by
some...magical force,
perhaps.

He trundled toward
the base of the tower,
and shambled up the
incline to the
entrance.
Page 11: Chaos paused upon
the last step on the
top of the cascading
stairway that led to a
somber, shale door
set in the base of the
stupendous monolith.

A feeling of doubt
washed over him,
quickly being shook
away, knowing he must
press on.
Page 12: He forged his iron will
anew into steel and
reached for the goblin
shaped knocker on the
left of a similar, troll
headed one. 

He recoiled in horror
when the statue's
eyes rolled about
madly.
Page 13: 
"Wahts we got here
Elliott?" the sentient
copper goblin giggled.

"I thinks its fresh
meat for the master."
squealed Elliott the
troll head.
Page 14: Shat-tap, bitch. You
sound like a shrieking
milkmaid who's just
seen a barewolf!
Page 15: "Oh, certainly," replied
the goblin. "But we are
only here to forewarn
the supple fools who
Master lures in.
Secure your ass
plate, noble knight! For
Master desires
manflesh more than
anything these days.

But business is
business, so says I.
Page 16: So enter, but 
remember us well.

For we are the only
pair of knockers you'll
ever see in this tower!
Hee Hee!"

The two copper beings
parted to the sides as
the gates swung
open.
Page 17: Chaos set forth in
determination. He
passed through the
foreboding entrance
and came upon a
crossroads.

Three halls diverged,
marked by troubling,
leering gargoyles. The
left probed deep into
the innermost clutches
of the burly ground.
Page 18: The one ahead
consisted of a
seemingly endless
hallway. The rightmost
path led up a
mesmerizing staircase.

Chaos' keen snout
sensed a moist wind
emanating from the
spiral staircase.
Page 19: Knowing that the
master wizard. Zhalfir
could only exist in a
solid state in sopping
climes, he turned and
began to ascend the
staircase.
Page 20: "Ware the seductions
of Master," the goblin
echoed from behind.
"Even the straightest
arrow can be bent!"

After the warning,
Elliott let loose a
squeal that sounded a
little bit like a fire
hose sprayed through
an electric fan filled
with pelicans and -
Page 21: whistling track
coaches who had a
little too much time on
their hands and liked
to play tug of war
behind the snack
shack but one day the
tennis kids came by
and tipped it over,
subsequently trapping
them in the tomblike
waste wallow and he
hated his life
Page 22: and all the days after
no one looked at him
quite the same way, not
even his family and
that's what Elliott's
scream sounded like.

Chaos ventured
deeper into the
labyrinthine halls. As
he progressed, he
began to fall into
a dreamlike state.
Page 23: The winding corridors
seemed to shift as
inexplicable enigmas
danced within his
primitive manbrain.

His rhythmic footsteps
were punctuated by
mysterious sounds;
sudden soft laughter,
or the quiet shutting
of a door.
Page 24: He felt a singular
sense of disquiet as
he strode ever
quicker down the
corridor, fighting the
trancelike waves of
unreality.

He was suddenly
aware of a vast
presence behind him,
and he whirled
around.
Page 25: Shield set and mace
drawn back, but
nothing was there, and
Chaos began to doubt
his own sanity.

§7(Certainly it wasn't
there in the first
place because he kills
a shit load of innocent
people.)
Page 26: Then a notion arose.
Perhaps Chaos was
not really wandering
the halls, not even
moving. Gods! 

He was wandering
within his own mind! He
must get back to
consciousness right
now, lest he wake up
with a sore ass.
Page 27: He struggled through
the blurring mire of
the dreamworld, trying
to reach out for
consciousness.

Finally, with all of his
will, he snapped back
awake, and found
himself in a dim, velvet
room.
Page 28: His armor covered in
rose petals, but
thankfully still on.

§0
§0Giovanni was like any other Mob Boss, had lots of money and wore gold chains. Sent out hit men to kill people he didn't like. Untill he was busted. Charged with 57  
Page 1: accounts of first degree murder, selling drugs, and kidnapping.§0
§0He was sentenced to§0
§0life in prison. That was untill he payed a bail of 7 millon dollars to have a full pardon and be free. He had almost no money. He had a fresh start.§0

§0Past Reputation§0
§0-----------------------§0
§0Even though he could start again, friends and family of the victims never forgive him. Neither did the police. §0
§0He had a reputation of being a cold blooded killer. Everywhere he went people would§0

Page 3: cower in fear or spit on him. He needed to do something to get the people to forgive him.§0
§0He tried commumnity service. No one would let him join a group. He tried starting a local business. Now one would give him the loan. He had no options
Page 4: He had to do something people would love him for and rember him for.§0
§0------------------------Chapter 3§0
§0The Plan§0
§0------------------------It took Giovanni a long time to come up with a plan. He thought about flying a plane to china and back in 6
Page 5: days. Impossible he thought. Next he thought about tight rope walking across America. Too hard for him. Finnally he thought, "I'll be a bear rider!" So he did become a bear rider. He rode it around where ever he went.§0

Page 4:      Introduction
=================== Welcome to potion brewing! If you're new, keep in mind that you need a brewing stand, glass bottles filled with water, and many ingredients, which vary depending on what type of potion you may want to create.
Page 5:      Introduction
=================== Every brewing stand has the capability to hold at maximum three bottles at a time, meaning you can make 3 potions for every single ingredient you add. Keep this in mind!
Page 6:   Base Ingredients
=================== These ingredients start all potions.
------------------- ?Nether Wart
?Glowstone Dust
?Redstone
?Fermented Spider Eye [Adding these to a water bottle will create a base potion. see page 11]
Page 7: Secondary Ingredients =================== ?Magma Creme
?Sugar
?Glistering Melon
?Spider Eye
?Ghast Tear
?Blaze Powder
?Fermented Spider Eye
?Golden Carrot
?Pufferfish
?Rabit's Foot
Page 8:         Modifiers
=================== Add these to a potion to alter their effects. -------------------?Redstone
[Increases duration]
?Glowstone Dust
[Increases potency]
?Gunpowder
[Turns into a splash]
?Fermented Spider Eye
[See next page]
Page 9:   Effect Corruption
=================== Fermented Spider Eyes will change a potion's base effect, often reversing it or producing a negative potion. A "corrupted" potion usually does the opposite of the original potion.
Page 10:       Base Potions
=================== Base potions, much like base ingredients, are the basis of all potions. These are the potions created by simply a watter bottle and a base ingredient together.
Page 11:    Awkward Potion

Page 14:     Effect Potions
===================Effect Potions are any potion that can be used to add any sort of effect onto a player. There are both positive and negative effect potions, both of which can give advantages in combat, or even in building or mining.
Page 15:    Positive Potions
=================== When used, these potions will apply a positive effect to the player.       POTION OF: ?Healing

Page 0:      Kaelin tensed his legs, preparing for his jump from the cliff. Nekros had jumped down and into the lake already. It was Kaelin's turn. He had never been the biggest fan of heights.§0
§0     Kaelin ran at full speed, and threw himself off the edge.
Page 1: He plumbeted toward the lake, more than a hundred feet below. The water felt like stone as he hit. He scrambled up to the surface, gasping for air. Nekros had already swum to the entrance of the cave at the base of the cliff. Kaelin followed suit.
Page 2: "That was a very graceful fall, Kaelin." Nekros chuckled.§0
§0"You did no better."§0
§0Kaelin shrugged. The two started readjusting their sword belts, getting ready for the expedition into the cave. §0
§0"You ready?" Kaelin looked at Nekros.
Page 3: "Yes, let's go."§0
§0Nekros picked up the bag they had lowered over the cliff before their jump, and pulled out a torch. §0
§0     They walked through the cave in silence for a while, until Kaelin spoke up.§0
§0"What is it you dragged me here for Nekros?"
Page 4: Nekros slowed his pace.§0
§0"I heard a rumor that in this cave, is the corpse of the prince. His sword was priceless."§0
§0"All of this based on a rumor Nekros?"§0
§0"Well do you have a better way to earn money Kaelin?"
Page 5: "No."§0
§0The two continued through the cave. They walked for the better part of three hours.§0
§0     The cave was easy to follow, with few alternate paths. Occasionally they would hear sounds from ahead in the cave, but Nekros 
Page 6: dismissed them as bats.§0
§0     Suddenly Nekros stopped, and peered around a bend in the cave. Kaelin looked too, and he saw. Two men, leaning over a corpse which must have belonged to the prince. The two men had cudgles in their hands, and were 
Page 7: bigger than both Kaelin and Nekros.§0
§0Nekros turned to Kaelin, speaking in a whisper.§0
§0"I'm going to go talk to them. Have my back."§0
§0With that he walked around the bend. When the two men saw him, then got into a battle stance.§0

Page 8: Nekros raised his hands. §0
§0"I don't want any trouble. I just want that sword."§0
§0He gestured toward the sword laying near the prince's corpse.§0
§0One of the men stepped forward. §0
§0"You will have to take it from us then."§0
§0The man swung his
Page 9: cudgle at Nekros, barely missing as he jumped to the side and drew his sword. §0
§0     Kaelin charged forward drawing his sword. The two men were shocked for a moment, but quickly resumed fighting. Kaelin engaged one of the men. He was strong, but slow.
Page 10: Kaelin knew he could win his fight. The man swung at Kaelins side. Kaelin jumped back. Man stumbled forward, off balance. Kaelin took his chance, stabbing his blade in the man's side. The man gasped and fell on the ground. Nekros finished off the 
Page 11: second man not long after ?Kaelin. §0
§0     They both sat on the ground, breathing heavily. After a long rest they picked up the sword and started the journey out of the cave.

Page 0: It was just supposed to be a trip to the village, like so many before it. A relatively carefree day of trading with the villagers for the goods they were so eager to share, for a small fee of course. Of course I should have known that in this
Page 1: strange and rugged land you can never become complacent and expect everything to be just fine. It was the kind of mistake every player makes at some point. The kind of mistake a player doesn't make twice, assuming they live through it that is.
Page 2: When I first arrived in this world I assumed I was alone, but after weeks of scouting out my surroundings I found a small village out on the plains not far to the east. Naturally I was excited about this find, especially when I learned that
Page 3: these villagers were friendly, unlike so many of the other creatures in this strange place. For the most part I found their demands to be fair. Wheat was plentiful enough, and I was happy to publish my journals for a few extra emeralds here§0

Page 4: and there. What I earned however didn't last long as I found that they had much to offer that I needed. In particular the priest with access to a sizable glowstone supply was a welcome surprise. While I could always get some myself, it's nice to
Page 5: be able to grab some now and then without having to dodge fireballs or hang precariously over enormous lakes of lava. I found myself spending more and more time at the village and I think it's fair to say I even regarded many of the villagers
Page 6: as friends. Still I had never spent the night in the town. I had my home and it was both secure and familiar making it a perfect retreat to weather the often turbulent evenings outside it's durable stone walls. As you can imagine this constant§0

Page 7: back and forth become rather tiresome and so I decided I'd make my next trip; this trip an over-night venture. I'd leave early from my home riding my fastest horse with a pack mule in tow, spend the whole day trading with the villagers. Rest§0

Page 8: in the village overnight, finalize some trading the next day, and finally head home pack and mule heavy laden with the spoils acquired over the course of the trip. "Who knows," I had said to myself "perhaps I'll even kick back and share a§0

Page 9: meal with the townsfolk before bed. Looking back, I see now that I had become complacent, assuming nothing bad could or would happen... Was I ever wrong. To say the evening hadn't gone quite as I'd imagined would be doing the term
Page 10: "understatement" a gross injustice. There was no warm meal and no soft bed this evening. Tonight was a night of cold iron, unsettling moans, and realized fears. Tonight was the first night of the siege, an event I had never heard of, nor
Page 11: ever even imagined possible, and one I fervently hoped would end sooner than it looked to. The first sign of trouble was a very loud banging on the door of the building I was spending the evening in, startling me so badly that I literally jump,
Page 12: turning a full 180 degrees in mid-air and bringing my sword down hard on the table that had snuck up behind me, only to realize as my panic subsided that the banging was in fact coming from outside the door. "I guess I owe the table an
Page 13: apology," I said to no one in particular as I collected myself and moved to the door to assess the real threat. A zombie, very similar to the dozens I'd killed since finding myself in this strange land could be seen standing outside the door,
Page 14: occasionally shifting from one side to the other and somehow weakening the integrity of the wooden barrier between myself and him as he did so. I turn back to the villagers in the building with me, a priest and a farmer, to warn them that the§0

Page 15: door is about to break only to have my warnings rendered moot by the loud cracking sound of the door finally losing its battle to the zombie outside. "I'm still standing in front of the door," I think suddenly to myself. I have only moments
Page 16: to react. Too late! I feel the zombies hand claw at my back scratching furrows into my iron breastplate until finally it finds the joint where my breastplate and greaves meet and scores a small chunk of my flesh. It takes only seconds for§0

Page 17: this event to register in my mind and for my thoughts to coalesce into a single statement to sum up the emotions and thoughts suddenly coursing through my mind; "it's going to be a long night." Having little choice I spin quickly around as
Page 18: I back away from the door avoiding loosing anymore of myself to the zombie ambling in after me. raising my sword I take a swing at the zombie, then another, each blow knocking the foul smelling creature off balance and back toward the door. A
Page 19: final swing drops the zombie to the floor as it lets out a cry signaling the end of its existence and alerting other zombies in the area that someone is fighting back. It takes only moments for reinforcements to arrive. All too suddenly a§0

Page 20: knee high zombie jumps through the doorway and latches onto my chest with a speed that you wouldn't expect from a zombie. This poor creature stands at not even half my height and is so obviously one of the lost children from the village that
Page 21: I find myself struggling to justify killing the creature. The moral dilemma quickly resolves itself however as this miniature zombie starts gnawing right through the material under the breastplate scoring a few small bites of fresh flesh.
Page 22: with a sudden cry of pain as the zombie's teeth find soft tissue I bring my sword around catching the thing by surprise, the sheer weight of the blade launching it across the room. It hits a wall and comes right back at me, seemingly
Page 23: un-phased. Another well placed swing atop its bulbous skull ends the threat of the baby zombie as three more come ambling through the door, their attention locked on the two terrified villagers huddling in the corner behind me. I raise my sword
Page 24: in a defensive stance, the effort of holding aloft the iron blade causing blood to trickle from my wounds. It's only then that I realize that my wounds aren't healing... I am hungry. I had been planning to get a hot meal before grabbing a room§0

Page 25: and getting some sleep, but the sudden zombie attack prevented me from getting that far. I quickly glance into my pack for something, anything to eat... naturally I had only packed enough for the trip here, assuming I could get food in the§0

Page 26: village. "Hopefully that's a mistake I'll live to regret," I think to myself as I mentally prepare myself to take on these three zombies all alone... Suddenly an idea strikes me. "The zombies are so focused on the villagers I could probably§0

Page 27: slip out of the house and away from the village largely unnoticed." I look back at the two cowering villagers hiding behind me in earnest as I contemplate leaving them to their fate. "This isn't my home and I'm not really that close to§0

Page 28: any of them. Why should I risk my life to save those I hardly know... Those who aren't even brave enough to stand and fight in defense of themselves?" The priest suddenly lets out a typical "hmmm," a common enough thing amongst the§0

Page 29: villagers. This time however the sound comes off a bit plaintiff, arguable the closest thing I had ever heard to a villager begging for their life. As the priest looked at me and I back at him it became clear what must be done. I swung around§0

Page 30: quickly, swinging as I did so and managed to catch the first zombie squarely in the chest with my iron blade causing him to stumble back, shifting his focus to me as he did so. Knowing that in order to save the villagers I had to get the§0

Page 31: attention of all three zombies I lunged headlong in-between the second and third zombies slicing wildly through the air with my sword as I did so and managing to score modest blows on each in turn. "Eat that zombie!" I shout as I make a move
Page 32: for the door, the two freshly struck zombies following as fervently as a new puppy does its owner. As I back towards the door I'm suddenly given a painful reminder that there's a third zombie in the form of a fresh pair of teeth marks on my§0

Page 33: left arm, one of the few exposed regions on my body. In shock I tear my arm away from the zombie's grasp loosing flesh to the beast's teeth as I do so. I spin around, still slightly off balance and sprint out the door. the zombies quickly§0

Page 34: follow me out, leaving the villagers behind to continue cowering in the building. As I turn to make sure the zombies followed me I hit something hard and solid, stopping me in my tracks and knocking me down. As I stare up waiting for my§0

Page 35: vision to clear a figure, clearly made in the image of a villager comes into focus. Whatever it is stands a full block taller than myself or any of the villagers and is much larger and more intimidating. It glances down then up to the three§0

Page 36: zombies still heading my way. It seems to realize instantly that the zombies are a threat and begins to stride directly toward them. I slowly get to my feet and watch in stunned awe as what I can only describe as some sort of golem threw up
Page 37: its long metallic arms with a level of force that instantly cracked bones as it made contact with the walking corpses, the sound making me cringe. The zombies were no match, made to look as little more than ragdolls fighting an iron giant.§0

Page 38: "whatever this thing is," I thought to myself "I'm glad it's on our side." I turned to look at the building I'd been in not moments ago to see the farmer peeking out of the gaping hole left in the shattered door. Looking around I see more§0

Page 39: zombies on the horizon... many more. I quickly jog over to the building. "There are more coming. I'll seal you inside so you'll be safe." I begin to pile stones up in the doorway to create a more solid barrier, but the priest stops me. With a§0

Page 40: looks that at once said "thank you for saving us" and "give me your sword" the villager grabbed my blade and a few emeralds that had fallen from my pack. With a look to the heavens and a quick prayer over the sword the priest returned my
Page 41: sword, now glowing slightly and warm to the touch. I took it in my hands; it felt lighter than before. With a look I nodded my thanks to the priest and finished sealing them inside. As I turn to seek out my newly enchanted swords first§0

Page 42: prey I realize that there's little need to seek them out as there's at least a dozen close enough that I can taste their foul breath. I take my first swing with the new blade striking the closest zombie on the left side of its skull, the§0

Page 43: blade burrowing so deeply that the top of the skull flipped open like a soup can lid as the zombie fell to the ground. "Now that's more like it!" I shouted in triumph lunging at the next closest zombie with equally devastating results. As§0

Page 1:               Day 1§0
§0---------------------§0
§0    I just met this world they call minecraft. I decided to log my whole life into this journal. Every memory or event that happens to me will go in here day by day.§0
§0
§0   Today the most wonderful
Page 2: thing happend. I was mining and I found some diamonds! I think I might use them to make a pickaxe so I can start constructing my house.  I want an old style house with a big roof. §0
§0
§0   It is starting to get lonley in this world 
Page 3: I wish I could find a companion.§0
§0
§0 Wow! I was walking home from my mine and I ran into a wolf. I used some bones to tame him, I guess now I won't be so lonley.. I think I will name is Ralph. Yea, me and Ralph sounds good.
Page 4:               Day 2§0
§0----------------------    Today me and ralph went to the pond. We sat there and fished for hours upon hours. I am starting to get better at this thing they call "life". One day I think I could actually do something.§0
§0Meh. Lets just 
Page 5: build for now.§0
§0
§0   I just started the construction of my house. It is a very lonley sad looking house. It seems to have nothing to bring in life. I need shelter so I guess I will have to live with my terrible building skills.
Page 6: I wish I could be like the other people. For some reason I seem to be an outcast in the minecraft community. I don't get it yet, maybe it just takes time. 
Page 7:                Day 3§0
§0----------------------§0
§0   I havn't been on this world very long. But it seems like forever with no friends. I feel lonley again, I have thoughts of quitting but I just don't. I have a feeling something will happen to me. Something bad
Page 8: later but good now. I feel like it will be the biggest adventure of my life. But who am I to think that. I am just another square.§0
§0
§0    I finally touched up my house a little bit. It still looks dark and lonley but I added some flowers to make it look 
Page 9: nicer. Just in case one day I happen to run into another person on this forsaken Earth.§0
§0
§0            Day 4§0
§0---------------------        I decided to ditch the old house and move by a pond. I really wanted to try and feel better. I figured the water could
Page 10: help my depression. Plus me and Ralph love to fish together.§0
§0
§0   For some reason Ralph seems like fishing is a bore. I am starting to get worried because he usually has a blast out here. He runs in the water and gets his long white hair wet
Page 11: and then shakes it off. I find it cute. I wonder if he is sick at all. I wouldn't know. I am just an idiot.§0
§0
§0              Day 5§0
§0----------------------     This very goreous girl joined my world! I am filled with happiness, I have never been this 
Page 12: happy ever in my life! I don't know how to explain the over welming love I have for this person. For some reason It makes me beleive in love at first site! I would try to talk to her but I doubt she would even find me remotely attractive, Im a loner.
Page 13:              Day 6§0
§0----------------------     I finally spoke to her, she seemed like a very nice person. I really like her, I hope someday we can be together in the same house and share the same love for things. The thing I find most attractive about her
Page 14: is her long blonde curly hair with her baby blue eyes. I can't explain it, she reminds me of the brightest diamond and the hottest torch. §0
§0
§0   I just showed her Ralph. I think she really likes him, this will give me a chance to hang out with her and 
Page 15: finally not be sad.§0
§0
§0              Day 7§0
§0----------------------      I finally worked up the nerve to speak a word to her. She said my nervousness was cute. This made me feel good inside. I hope I can capture this feeling forever!
Page 16:     I asked her if she wanted to come over and we can have a picnic under the stars. I am still waiting for a reply, I think she will say yes, but you never know.§0
§0
§0   Two whole hours later which felt like years she finally received my letter.
Page 17:     Yes, I had to send her a letter even though she lives across the street. I was too nervous she would turn me down and I would ruin everything.§0
§0
§0             Day 8§0
§0----------------------   Wr finally went on our first date! I am so happy!
Page 18: I am so in love, she said that she really likes me and she is thinking of marriage. This is so good for, I can finally be a normal "square" in this society of Minecraft.§0
§0
§0               Day 9§0
§0----------------------       Today is a bad day, Ralph has died
Page 19: my first companion of this brutal world. My sadness overwelms me, even though I am happy I am sad. Can anyone explain this!!§0
§0
§0   I miss Ralph so much! I just want to go fishing with him again. I want to see him wave the water off his fur. Ohhhh I miss him
Page 20: this is terrible! I hope you guys reading this in the future can understand my grief.§0
§0
§0   My future wife April is a wise lady, she tells me that everything has a purpose and I will soon find out why he died. I just hope that is soon.
Page 21:               Day 10§0
§0----------------------     Today is our marriage, even though I was just sad I feel nothing now. All I feel is love and passion for my wife April. I hope we can live in our newly  bought mansion by the lake. I think I can move on with
Page 22: my life. I am starting to think I can be happy in life, it seemed like I was always sad. Now I feel happiness.§0
§0
§0   I just held my first sword, I never used to fight mobs. I just ran and ran to shelter, yes you could say I was a weak person but
Page 23: I was afraid of the zombie and the creepers. The things that scare me the most are the skeletons. They are so accurate with their stupid bows and arrows. I started to learn how to use sword because I need to protect my lovely wife. Her life means
Page 24: everything.§0
§0
§0                Day 11§0
§0----------------------     I am panicing right now, I heard recent news of a zombie invasion. They have tooken over all the cities around us! I am scared for my life and everyone I love.
Page 25: my one focus right now is protecting my wife. She is the world and I couldn't live without her. §0
§0
§0   There is no keeping tracks of the days anymore. We have sat in this house closet  for I don't know how many days. I don't have the
Page 26: mental copacity to keep track of the days right now. I am going insane! The constant threat of zombies around our house. I am starting to think out defenses are getting weak. This house was built to live in not to withhold a zombie invasion!
Page 27:    We are both scared, My wife is shaking in my arms, I have no idea what to do. I can't fight the zombies there is more than 1,000 outside, they would just take my life and love from my wife.§0
§0
§0    I think it has been 9-10 hours since my last journal 
Page 28: entry. I don't know what day it is, all I know is we are going to die. I hope we can die in each others arms so death can come get us together.§0
§0
§0THERE IN THERE IN I CAN'T DO ANYTHING APRIL APRIL! SHE IS BEING DRAGGED
Page 29: THE ZOMBIES HAVE HER. I AM SORRY MY LOVE. I AM HIDING IN A CLOSET SCARED FOR MY LIFE. I WILL COME FOR YOU!§0
§0
§0   She has been gone, it feels like weeks, months or years! I don't know! All I know is I am coming for her.
Page 30:    I started training today. I am training to be a master at fighting these horrible beast. They will pay for what they did. None of them will live, all will die at the end of my sword. Their blood will spill everywhere. Their lives is the payment
Page 31: for taking my love.§0
§0
§0    I have been training for what feels like 10 days straight. I complete excercises like swinging my sword and kicking hay bails. I am gaining strength, I havn't ate all day I am running of pure adrenaline.
Page 32:    I am starting my journey, I will find my love, I will kill every beast that walks in my way. THIS DAY MARKS A CHANGE IN THE WORLD.§0
§0
§0   She was right, I have a purpose and I have found it. To save her.
Page 33:    I finally have stepped outside the doors. I will not be writing for awhile, I will be slaying and cutting the heads off these beast.§0
§0
§0  I managed to find a hiding spot to sleep tonight. I am in a tree, a birch tree to be exact. This feels like a safe 
Page 34: place to rest. No hiding only rest, I will wake up as early as possible find some food to ration and be on my way.§0
§0
§0   I am stuck on a roof surrounded by zombies. There is no way I can survive. I have to stay here until the zombies think I am gone.
Page 35:     It is the middle of the night, I just had the wildest dream ever. April came to me in my dream and spoke to me. All she said was a riddle. "A place to chase, and have a happy face". §0

Page 38:     My eyes went black, all I saw was green faces and a brutal world. I saw the light, someone spoke to me, someone I didn't know. They said " You can do it ". After that I felt a pull, almost like being pulled back down to earth. I woke up and jolted! I

Page 40:    I ran up to her, I tried to hug her and say " I love you ". But when she turned I saw her real form. They had turned her. She was one with the beast. I didn't know what to do. I knew I had to the right thing. My love and I...........

Page 1:  Toward the end of the 1940s, Soviet researchers sealed five prison inmates in an airtight chamber and dosed them with an experimental stimulant gas to test the effects of prolonged sleep deprivation. 
Page 2: Their behavior was observed via two-way mirrors and their conversations monitored electronically. They had been promised their freedom if they could go entirely without sleep for 30 days.
Page 3: The first few days of the experiment passed uneventfully. By the fifth day, however, the subjects began showing signs of stress and were overheard bemoaning their circumstances. 
Page 4: hey stopped conversing with their fellow inmates, choosing instead to whisper compromising information about one another into the microphones, apparently in an effort to win the favor of the researchers. 
Page 5: Paranoia set §0in.On§0 the ninth day the screaming began. First one subject, then another, was observed running around the chamber screaming at the top of his lungs for hours on end. 
Page 6: Equally disconcerting was the reaction of the quieter subjects, who began ripping apart the books they'd been given to read, smearing the pages with feces, and plastering them over the mirrored windows so their actions could no longer be observed.
Page 7: Just as suddenly, the screaming stopped. The subjects ceased communicating altogether. Three long days passed without a sound from inside the §0chamber.Fearing§0 the worst, the researchers addressed the subjects via the intercom.
Page 8: We are opening the chamber to test the microphones," they said. "Step away from the door and lie flat on the floor or you will be shot. Compliance will earn one of you your immediate freedom."A voice from inside answered, We no longer want to be freed."
Page 9: Two more days passed without contact of any kind as the scientists debated what to do next. Finally, they decided to terminate the experiment.
Page 10: At midnight on the fifteenth day the stimulant gas was flushed from the chamber and replaced with fresh air in preparation for the subjects' release.
Page 11: Far from being pleased at the prospect of leaving the chamber, the subjects began screaming as if in fear for their §0lives.They§0 begged to have the gas turned back on. Instead,the researchers unsealed the door to the
Page 12: chamber and sent armed soldiers inside to retrieve them. Nothing could have prepared them for the carnage they witnessed upon entering. One subject was found dead, lying face-down in sixinches of bloody water. Chunks of his
Page 13: flesh had been torn off and stuffed into the floor drain. All of the test subjects were found to have been severely mutilated, in fact. What's worse, the wounds appeared to be self-inflicted.
Page 14: They had ripped open their own abdomens and disemboweled themselves with their bare hands. Some had even eaten their own flesh. The four who were still alive seemed terrified of falling asleep and refused to leave the chamber, again pleading
Page 15: with the researchers to turn the gas back on. When the soldiers attempted to remove the inmates by force, they fought back so ferociously they couldn't believe their eyes. One suffered a ruptured spleen and lost so much blood 
Page 16: there was literally nothing left for his heart to pump, yet continued flailing for a full three minutes until his lifeless body collapsed. The remaining subjects were restrained and transported to a medical facility for treatment. 
Page 17: The first to be operated on fought so furiously against being anesthetized that he tore muscles and broke bones during the struggle. As soon as the anesthetic took effect his heart stopped and he died. The rest underwent surgery without sedation.
Page 18: Far from feeling any pain, however, they laughed hysterically on the operating table -- so hysterically that the doctors, perhaps fearing for their own sanity, administered a paralytic agent to immobilize them. After surgery the survivors were asked why 
Page 19: they had mutilated themselves, and why they so desperately wanted to go back on the stimulant gas. Each, in turn, gave the same answer: "I must remain awake."The researchers considered euthanizing them to obliterate every trace of the failed 
Page 20: experiment, but were overruled by their commanding officer, who ordered that it be resumed immediately, with three of the researchers joining the inmates in the sealed chamber. Horrified at the prospect, 
Page 21: the chief researcher pulled out a pistol and shot the commanding officer point blank. He then turned and shot one of the two surviving subjects. Pointing his gun at the last one left alive, he asked, What are you? I must know!"
Page 22: "Have you forgotten so easily?" the subject said, smiling. We are you. We are the madness that lurks within you all, begging to be free at every moment in your deepest animal mind. We are what you hide from in your beds every night.
Page 23: We are what you sedate into silence and paralysis when you go to the nocturnal haven where we cannot tread."
Page 24: The researcher fired a bullet into his heart. The EEG monitor flatlined as the subject murmured these last words: "§0So...nearly...free."§0

§2   §0One night a woman went out for drinks with her girlfriends. She left the bar fairly late at night, got in her car and onto the deserted highway. After a few minutes she noticed a lone pair of headlights in her rear-view mirror, 
Page 2: approaching at a pace just slightly quicker than hers. As the car pulled up behind her she glanced and saw the turn signal on  the car was going to pass  when suddenly it swerved back behind her, pulled up dangerously close to her tailgate 
Page 3: and the brights flashed. Now she was getting nervous. The lights dimmed for a moment and then the brights came back on and the car behind her surged forward. The frightened woman struggled to keep her eyes on the road and fought 
Page 4: the urge to look at the car behind her. Finally, her exit approached but the car continued to follow, flashing the brights periodically. Through every stoplight and turn, it followed her until she pulled into her driveway.
Page 5: She figured her only hope was to make a mad dash into the house and call the §0police.As§0 she flew from the car, so did the driver of the car behind her  and he screamed, "Lock the door and call the police! Call 911!"
Page 6: When the police arrived the horrible truth was finally revealed to the woman. The man in the car had been trying to save her. As he pulled up behind her and his headlights illuminated her car, 
Page 7: he saw the silhouette of a man with a butcher knife rising up from the back seat to stab her,so he flashed his brights and the figure crouched back down.

§5     §0A girl and her boyfriend are making out in his car. They had parked in the woods so no one would see them. When they were done, the boy got out to pee and the girl waited for him in the safety of the car.
Page 2: After waiting five minutes, the girl got out of the car to look for her boyfriend. Suddenly, she sees a man in the shadows. Scared, she gets back in the car to drive away, when she hears a very faint squeak... squeak... squeak...
Page 3: This continued a few seconds until the girl decided she had no choice but to drive off. She hit the gas as hard as possible but couldn't go anywhere, because someone had tied a rope from the bumper of the car to a nearby tree.
Page 4: Well, the girl slams on the gas again and then hears a loud scream. She gets out of the car and realizes that her boyfriend is hanging from the tree. The squeaky noises were his shoes slightly scraping across the top of the car!!!§0

§0=================== §0
§0An incredibly basic book for learning simple German phrases. §0

§0   Written by§6 Neskah§0.§0

Page 1: 
§0   §3§lINTRODUCTION§0
§0===================Welcome, reader! In this book, we will be discussing very basic German conversational skills. Please note: This book will §cNOT §0Fully teach you German.
Page 2: §3§l    NON-ENGLISH§0
§3§l      LETTERS§0
§0=================== If you're going to learn German, even basic phrases, there are 4 special characters you have to be aware of. 3 of them are what we call Umlaute. Umlaute are either an A, O, or U with 2 dots.
Page 3: §3ä§0: This character sounds very close to pronouncing the English letter A in the alphabet. (§aAYY§0), although it has less of a twang to it. Instead of pronouncing with a Y sound on the end, try saying "eh?"
Page 4: §3ü§0: With the U umlaut, things get more difficult. Try making an E sound, as in the word §6Me§0. While making this continued EE sound, curve your lips dramatically, like you're kissing someone or making an U sound. 
Page 5: §3ö§0: Like the U umlaut, combine the U sound with an English A. As in the word §6bay§0. While making this A sound, curve your lips, the sound produced should be a U umlaut.§0
§cPlease use Google for this part, it's very difficult to describe on-paper.
Page 6: §3ß§0: This is an Eszet. Make sure not to mistake it for a B, as it's pronounced nothing like it. The eszet is basically a short way to write a double s in German.§0
§0Example:§0
§6Füßen§0, a short way to write §6Füssen§0. §0
§0(§6Feet§0, in English.)
Page 7: A few other things to note about pronounciation of German letters:§0
§0===================§6W§0: Pronounced exactly like an English V.§0
§6V§0: Pronounced exactly like an English F.§0
§6J§0: Pronounced like an English Y. Example:§0
§0Ja = Yah.
Page 8: §6R§0: Google this one, too. It's pronounced very much like a French R, a gutteral sound from the back of your throat.§0
§6Z§0: Pronounced like an English TS. As in Pan§6ts§0. For example, Zehn (ten) is pronounced like Tsayn.
Page 9: Just like in English, groups of letters will make certain sounds together.§0
§6sch§0: Pronounced exactly like an English SH. Example: Tschüss!§0
§0would be pronounced like tshooss. (It's similar to saying Cheers! to a friend.)
Page 10: §6eu§0: Pronounced like an English -oy, as in the word b§6oy§0.§0
§6äu§0: Exactly like the EU, it is pronounced like -oy.§0
§6ie§0: Pronounced like an English ee, as in B§6ee§0.§0
§6ei§0: Pronounced like the English letter I, as in NEIN!
Page 11: §6-ch§0: The infamous flem, like you're coughing up a hairball. I'd recommend Googling this one, too.§0
§6-r§0: When an R comes at the end of a word, like a British accent, it is not pronounced. Example: Besser is pronounced like Bessah.
Page 12: §cth§0: This one is in red because it is NOT pronounced in German like in English. There is not a TH sound (like in the) in German. A TH together is simply pronounced like a T.
Page 13: Keep in mind that silent letters are almost nonexistant in German! Often you will find E's on the end of words, these are pronounced like (uh), like you're thinking about something. (uhhhh)§0
§0Example: Bitte is pronounced bit-tuh
Page 14: Now, on to what you came here for! Phrase-learning!§0

§0    I just met this world they call minecraft. I decided to log my whole life into this journal. Every memory or event that happens to me will go in here day by day.§0
§0
§0   Today the most wonderful
Page 2: thing happend. I was mining and I found some diamonds! I think I might use them to make a pickaxe so I can start constructing my house.  I want an old style house with a big roof. §0
§0
§0   It is starting to get lonley in this world 
Page 3: I wish I could find a companion.§0
§0
§0 Wow! I was walking home from my mine and I ran into a wolf. I used some bones to tame him, I guess now I won't be so lonley.. I think I will name is Ralph. Yea, me and Ralph sounds good.
Page 4:               Day 2§0
§0----------------------    Today me and ralph went to the pond. We sat there and fished for hours upon hours. I am starting to get better at this thing they call "life". One day I think I could actually do something.§0
§0Meh. Lets just 
Page 5: build for now.§0
§0
§0   I just started the construction of my house. It is a very lonley sad looking house. It seems to have nothing to bring in life. I need shelter so I guess I will have to live with my terrible building skills.
Page 6: I wish I could be like the other people. For some reason I seem to be an outcast in the minecraft community. I don't get it yet, maybe it just takes time. 
Page 7:                Day 3§0
§0----------------------§0
§0   I havn't been on this world very long. But it seems like forever with no friends. I feel lonley again, I have thoughts of quitting but I just don't. I have a feeling something will happen to me. Something bad
Page 8: later but good now. I feel like it will be the biggest adventure of my life. But who am I to think that. I am just another square.§0

§0    I finally touched up my house a little bit. It still looks dark and lonley but I added some flowers to make it look 
Page 9: nicer. Just in case one day I happen to run into another person on this forsaken Earth.§0
§0
§0            Day 4§0
§0---------------------        I decided to ditch the old house and move by a pond. I really wanted to try and feel better. I figured the water could
Page 10: help my depression. Plus me and Ralph love to fish together.§0
§0
§0   For some reason Ralph seems like fishing is a bore. I am starting to get worried because he usually has a blast out here. He runs in the water and gets his long white hair wet
Page 11: and then shakes it off. I find it cute. I wonder if he is sick at all. I wouldn't know. I am just an idiot.§0
§0
§0              Day 5§0
§0----------------------     This very goreous girl joined my world! I am filled with happiness, I have never been this 
Page 12: happy ever in my life! I don't know how to explain the over welming love I have for this person. For some reason It makes me beleive in love at first site! I would try to talk to her but I doubt she would even find me remotely attractive, Im a loner.
Page 13:              Day 6§0
§0----------------------     I finally spoke to her, she seemed like a very nice person. I really like her, I hope someday we can be together in the same house and share the same love for things. The thing I find most attractive about her
Page 14: is her long blonde curly hair with her baby blue eyes. I can't explain it, she reminds me of the brightest diamond and the hottest torch. §0
§0
§0   I just showed her Ralph. I think she really likes him, this will give me a chance to hang out with her and 
Page 15: finally not be sad.§0
§0
§0              Day 7§0
§0----------------------      I finally worked up the nerve to speak a word to her. She said my nervousness was cute. This made me feel good inside. I hope I can capture this feeling forever!
Page 16:     I asked her if she wanted to come over and we can have a picnic under the stars. I am still waiting for a reply, I think she will say yes, but you never know.§0
§0
§0   Two whole hours later which felt like years she finally received my letter.
Page 17:     Yes, I had to send her a letter even though she lives across the street. I was too nervous she would turn me down and I would ruin everything.§0
§0
§0             Day 8§0
§0----------------------   Wr finally went on our first date! I am so happy!
Page 18: I am so in love, she said that she really likes me and she is thinking of marriage. This is so good for, I can finally be a normal "square" in this society of Minecraft.§0
§0
§0               Day 9§0
§0----------------------       Today is a bad day, Ralph has died
Page 19: my first companion of this brutal world. My sadness overwelms me, even though I am happy I am sad. Can anyone explain this!!§0
§0
§0   I miss Ralph so much! I just want to go fishing with him again. I want to see him wave the water off his fur. Ohhhh I miss him
Page 20: this is terrible! I hope you guys reading this in the future can understand my grief.§0
§0
§0   My future wife April is a wise lady, she tells me that everything has a purpose and I will soon find out why he died. I just hope that is soon.
Page 21:               Day 10§0
§0----------------------     Today is our marriage, even though I was just sad I feel nothing now. All I feel is love and passion for my wife April. I hope we can live in our newly  bought mansion by the lake. I think I can move on with
Page 22: my life. I am starting to think I can be happy in life, it seemed like I was always sad. Now I feel happiness.§0
§0
§0   I just held my first sword, I never used to fight mobs. I just ran and ran to shelter, yes you could say I was a weak person but
Page 23: I was afraid of the zombie and the creepers. The things that scare me the most are the skeletons. They are so accurate with their stupid bows and arrows. I started to learn how to use sword because I need to protect my lovely wife. Her life means
Page 24: everything.§0
§0
§0                Day 11§0
§0----------------------     I am panicing right now, I heard recent news of a zombie invasion. They have tooken over all the cities around us! I am scared for my life and everyone I love.
Page 25: my one focus right now is protecting my wife. She is the world and I couldn't live without her. §0
§0
§0   There is no keeping tracks of the days anymore. We have sat in this house closet  for I don't know how many days. I don't have the
Page 26: mental copacity to keep track of the days right now. I am going insane! The constant threat of zombies around our house. I am starting to think out defenses are getting weak. This house was built to live in not to withhold a zombie invasion!
Page 27:    We are both scared, My wife is shaking in my arms, I have no idea what to do. I can't fight the zombies there is more than 1,000 outside, they would just take my life and love from my wife.§0
§0
§0    I think it has been 9-10 hours since my last journal 
Page 28: entry. I don't know what day it is, all I know is we are going to die. I hope we can die in each others arms so death can come get us together.§0
§0
§0THERE IN THERE IN I CAN'T DO ANYTHING APRIL APRIL! SHE IS BEING DRAGGED
Page 29: THE ZOMBIES HAVE HER. I AM SORRY MY LOVE. I AM HIDING IN A CLOSET SCARED FOR MY LIFE. I WILL COME FOR YOU!§0
§0
§0   She has been gone, it feels like weeks, months or years! I don't know! All I know is I am coming for her.
Page 30:    I started training today. I am training to be a master at fighting these horrible beast. They will pay for what they did. None of them will live, all will die at the end of my sword. Their blood will spill everywhere. Their lives is the payment
Page 31: for taking my love.§0
§0
§0    I have been training for what feels like 10 days straight. I complete excercises like swinging my sword and kicking hay bails. I am gaining strength, I havn't ate all day I am running of pure adrenaline.
Page 32:    I am starting my journey, I will find my love, I will kill every beast that walks in my way. THIS DAY MARKS A CHANGE IN THE WORLD.§0
§0
§0   She was right, I have a purpose and I have found it. To save her.
Page 33:    I finally have stepped outside the doors. I will not be writing for awhile, I will be slaying and cutting the heads off these beast.§0
§0
§0  I managed to find a hiding spot to sleep tonight. I am in a tree, a birch tree to be exact. This feels like a safe 
Page 34: place to rest. No hiding only rest, I will wake up as early as possible find some food to ration and be on my way.§0
§0
§0   I am stuck on a roof surrounded by zombies. There is no way I can survive. I have to stay here until the zombies think I am gone.
Page 35:     It is the middle of the night, I just had the wildest dream ever. April came to me in my dream and spoke to me. All she said was a riddle. "A place to chase, and have a happy face". §0
§0
§0   THAT'S IT! I KNOW THE ANSWER TO THE RIDDLE!
Page 36: I used to take Ralph to the park and chase him. Playing with made me smile. She is hinting for me to come to the park. I know it! She is there! Oh thank you god! THANK YOU!§0
§0
§0  It is an hour walk to park, I set out at night so I could try and sneak past 
Page 37: the beast. I grabbed one torch to help guide me through the night.§0
§0
§0    UH OH! I have made a mistake I am trapped in a bathroom being swarmed by zombies. I cannot do anything. Please god help me! HELP! 
Page 38:     My eyes went black, all I saw was green faces and a brutal world. I saw the light, someone spoke to me, someone I didn't know. They said " You can do it ". After that I felt a pull, almost like being pulled back down to earth. I woke up and jolted! I
Page 39: somehow was alive and ok. Maybe it was a dream, just maybe. I continued to the park, it was still pitch black and I had lost my torch for the night. I was working of pure instinct. I finally made it. There she WAS APRIL WAS THERE!§0
§0I AM FILL WITH JOY!
Page 40:    I ran up to her, I tried to hug her and say " I love you ". But when she turned I saw her real form. They had turned her. She was one with the beast. I didn't know what to do. I knew I had to the right thing. My love and I...........
Page 41:     I kneeled her down and confessed my love.§0

§0
§0I want to end this
Page 43: I want you guys to know what happens to me and to the world.§0

§0---------------------§0
§0    I just met this world they call minecraft. I decided to log my whole life into this journal. Every memory or event that happens to me will go in here day by day.§0
§0
§0   Today the most wonderful
Page 2: thing happend. I was mining and I found some diamonds! I think I might use them to make a pickaxe so I can start constructing my house.  I want an old style house with a big roof. §0
§0
§0   It is starting to get lonley in this world 
Page 3: I wish I could find a companion.§0
§0
§0 Wow! I was walking home from my mine and I ran into a wolf. I used some bones to tame him, I guess now I won't be so lonley.. I think I will name is Ralph. Yea, me and Ralph sounds good.
Page 4:               Day 2§0
§0----------------------    Today me and ralph went to the pond. We sat there and fished for hours upon hours. I am starting to get better at this thing they call "life". One day I think I could actually do something.§0
§0Meh. Lets just 
Page 5: build for now.§0
§0
§0   I just started the construction of my house. It is a very lonley sad looking house. It seems to have nothing to bring in life. I need shelter so I guess I will have to live with my terrible building skills.
Page 6: I wish I could be like the other people. For some reason I seem to be an outcast in the minecraft community. I don't get it yet, maybe it just takes time. 
Page 7:                Day 3§0
§0----------------------§0
§0   I havn't been on this world very long. But it seems like forever with no friends. I feel lonley again, I have thoughts of quitting but I just don't. I have a feeling something will happen to me. Something bad
Page 8: later but good now. I feel like it will be the biggest adventure of my life. But who am I to think that. I am just another square.§0
§0
§0    I finally touched up my house a little bit. It still looks dark and lonley but I added some flowers to make it look 
Page 9: nicer. Just in case one day I happen to run into another person on this forsaken Earth.§0
§0
§0            Day 4§0
§0---------------------        I decided to ditch the old house and move by a pond. I really wanted to try and feel better. I figured the water could
Page 10: help my depression. Plus me and Ralph love to fish together.§0
§0
§0   For some reason Ralph seems like fishing is a bore. I am starting to get worried because he usually has a blast out here. He runs in the water and gets his long white hair wet
Page 11: and then shakes it off. I find it cute. I wonder if he is sick at all. I wouldn't know. I am just an idiot.§0

§0----------------------     This very goreous girl joined my world! I am filled with happiness, I have never been this 
Page 12: happy ever in my life! I don't know how to explain the over welming love I have for this person. For some reason It makes me beleive in love at first site! I would try to talk to her but I doubt she would even find me remotely attractive, Im a loner.
Page 13:              Day 6§0
§0----------------------     I finally spoke to her, she seemed like a very nice person. I really like her, I hope someday we can be together in the same house and share the same love for things. The thing I find most attractive about her
Page 14: is her long blonde curly hair with her baby blue eyes. I can't explain it, she reminds me of the brightest diamond and the hottest torch. §0

Page 18: I am so in love, she said that she really likes me and she is thinking of marriage. This is so good for, I can finally be a normal "square" in this society of Minecraft.§0

§0=================== §0
§0An incredibly basic book for learning simple German phrases. §0
§0
§0   Written by§6 Neskah§0.§0
§0
§0
§0
§3?§0: Ekip Publishings
Page 1: 
§0   §3§lINTRODUCTION§0
§0===================Welcome, reader! In this book, we will be discussing very basic German conversational skills. Please note: This book will §cNOT §0Fully teach you German.
Page 2: §3§l    NON-ENGLISH§0
§3§l      LETTERS§0
§0=================== If you're going to learn German, even basic phrases, there are 4 special characters you have to be aware of. 3 of them are what we call Umlaute. Umlaute are either an A, O, or U with 2 dots.
Page 3: §3ä§0: This character sounds very close to pronouncing the English letter A in the alphabet. (§aAYY§0), although it has less of a twang to it. Instead of pronouncing with a Y sound on the end, try saying "eh?"
Page 4: §3ü§0: With the U umlaut, things get more difficult. Try making an E sound, as in the word §6Me§0. While making this continued EE sound, curve your lips dramatically, like you're kissing someone or making an U sound. 
Page 5: §3ö§0: Like the U umlaut, combine the U sound with an English A. As in the word §6bay§0. While making this A sound, curve your lips, the sound produced should be a U umlaut.§0
§cPlease use Google for this part, it's very difficult to describe on-paper.
Page 6: §3ß§0: This is an Eszet. Make sure not to mistake it for a B, as it's pronounced nothing like it. The eszet is basically a short way to write a double s in German.§0
§0Example:§0
§6Füßen§0, a short way to write §6Füssen§0. §0
§0(§6Feet§0, in English.)
Page 7: A few other things to note about pronounciation of German letters:§0
§0===================§6W§0: Pronounced exactly like an English V.§0
§6V§0: Pronounced exactly like an English F.§0
§6J§0: Pronounced like an English Y. Example:§0
§0Ja = Yah.
Page 8: §6R§0: Google this one, too. It's pronounced very much like a French R, a gutteral sound from the back of your throat.§0
§6Z§0: Pronounced like an English TS. As in Pan§6ts§0. For example, Zehn (ten) is pronounced like Tsayn.
Page 9: Just like in English, groups of letters will make certain sounds together.§0
§6sch§0: Pronounced exactly like an English SH. Example: Tschüss!§0
§0would be pronounced like tshooss. (It's similar to saying Cheers! to a friend.)
Page 10: §6eu§0: Pronounced like an English -oy, as in the word b§6oy§0.§0
§6äu§0: Exactly like the EU, it is pronounced like -oy.§0
§6ie§0: Pronounced like an English ee, as in B§6ee§0.§0
§6ei§0: Pronounced like the English letter I, as in NEIN!
Page 11: §6-ch§0: The infamous flem, like you're coughing up a hairball. I'd recommend Googling this one, too.§0
§6-r§0: When an R comes at the end of a word, like a British accent, it is not pronounced. Example: Besser is pronounced like Bessah.
Page 12: §cth§0: This one is in red because it is NOT pronounced in German like in English. There is not a TH sound (like in the) in German. A TH together is simply pronounced like a T.
Page 13: Keep in mind that silent letters are almost nonexistant in German! Often you will find E's on the end of words, these are pronounced like (uh), like you're thinking about something. (uhhhh)§0
§0Example: Bitte is pronounced bit-tuh
Page 14: Now, on to what you came here for! Phrase-learning!§0

§0These are very simple phrases, that if practiced enough, could come in handy when travelling.

	Title: The Name Steve
	Author: jjp1234
	Type: Written

Page 0: Don't ask me what I'm doing here, because I don't know. One day, I woke up in the middle of a forest, covered in snow, devoid of all memory and sense of identity. Why? I have no clue. It almost doesn't matter. I spent the first couple of hours calling for
Page 1: help, wandering around hoping I'd fine someone nearby. After a while, I came to the reluctant conclusion that I was well and truly isolated: no sounds of human voices, no hum of tires on distant roadways; nothing but the trill of far off birds and
Page 2: rustling branches in the wind. There might have been a cow nearby from all the mooing, but I couldn't find it.§0
§0I might not have know who I am, or why I woke up in this snowy forest, but that didn't mean I was going to sit down and let depression take me
Page 3: along with the wolves. I needed a plan of action, need to find a way to survive. But first, a man needs to know himself before he can trust himself, and because my old name was lost to my departed memory. I have decided to call myself Steve. Its a good 
Page 4: name.I spent some time searching the area, looking for anything that might be useful to me. Tools and weapons would be my first priority--don't ask me how I knew, but I could tell the forest would be dangerous at night, I don't know why. There
Page 5: wasn't much, not even a single fallen branch on the ground, just smooth snow and straight pine trees. i tried to grab hold of a few rocks peeking up from the soil,but they were firmly stuck. I'd need something to pry them free, or maybe break them away. I
Page 6: spotted a tree nearby and went to it, running my hands over the dark brown bark. It was a good tree.. strong and healthy.§0
§0
§0So I punched it.§0
§0
§0Pulp and bark flew as my hard fists broke chunk after chunk.
Page 7:  I gritted my teeth against the jarring in my arms and kept going until the whole thing broke through and crashed to the §0ground.Chest§0 heaving from the exertion, I gathered the wood and sat down, examining the pieces. I broke some of the longer chunks into
Page 8: thick sticks, then stabbed on of them into piece of wood shaped like a blade.§0
§0I grinned as I hefted the wooden axe I'd made, then swung it around experimentally. It felt good. I used the axe to fell several more tress until I had enough wood to make all
Page 9: the tools I needed: a shovel, sword and a pickaxe--the latter of which I used to break those stubborn stone from the ground. I stowed the rocks away for later use and strapped the tools to my back. I kept the sword out though, the feeling of danger in the
Page 10: woods tickling the back of my mind. Thus armed, I set off in search of food and shelter.I won't bore you with the details of my struggle against starvation and §0wolves.Suffice§0 it to say, it was a struggle. I fought, bled and conquered. I stumbled over
Page 11: hills and down into water-filled valleys, climbing trees to see the path ahead. I slew cows and ate their flesh to stay alive.I fell off cliffs and broke bones, spending days waiting for them to heal. I briefly marveled at how quickly the wounds mended,
Page 12: but wasted no time in pressing on once they did. At night times, I was attacked by monsters, proving my intuition about the forest to be correct. I hid from the darkness, lighting the small mud huts I'd built along the way with torches until the sim rose
Page 13: once again. I never knew why the world I'd woken up in was filled with skeletons and zombies, but it didn't really matter, I bashed their heads in with stone swords nonetheless. There were more questions to be had than answers, and I knew I would never
Page 14: know half of them.§0
§0
§0I had to SURVIVE!§0
§0
§0Weeks later, exhausted, clothes ripped and torn, blood from numerous cuts on my legs trailing into my socks, I finally found mountains. Majestic. I climbed them each, looking for the ideal spot to build a home
Page 15: far away from the oprressive trees and monster-filled shadows of the forest.I avoided the caves beneath those mountains, fearful of skeletons and massive spiders.I knew I would have to venture inside them eventually, but no then. I finally found a flat
Page 16: topped peak that overlooked the forests to the eats, and the ocean to the west. From its heights, I would be able to see the while land, and defend my homestead from intruders.§0
§0
§0It was good.
Page 17: That was a few months ago. I've since become used to this way of life, in this strange land. The name of Steve fits me like a glove, and I am the master of my modest stone home. I've raised cattle, planted wheat, and baked bread. I've explored those
Page 18: mysterious caved and returned the victor,bringing home coal for fires, iron for tools and armor, precious gold and even a priceless diamond. I am king of all I see, master of this forsaken land And then yesterday, my house blew up.... The building in 
Page 19: peices, the monsters who blew this place to shambles. I gave them a name. I call them§0

Coconut, you were no where as Coco or as nutty as your name. You were always so responsible and took such care raising the castle.

STORY WRITTEN BY

INSPIRED BY THE CRUSHES OF HER PAST

ALL CHARACTERS ARE FICTIONAL AND DO NOT REPRESENT REAL PEOPLE //


Page 1: REVIEWS:

Still a better love story than twilight - Everyone

5/5 Would Finger to again - 80% of lesbians

Muttsworld Lesbian Erotica 2013 Award
Page 2: Audrey was a tall, long-haired brunette with brown eyes and the face of a goddess. She was everyone's dream. Unfortunately for the male population this woman was blessed with the curse of being a lesbian. Countless men and women were dumbstruck by her
Page 3: looks. The dominate, aggressive, Audrey had no preference for men. She enjoyed taking submissive women and turning them into her playtoys for the evening.

Audrey went to a coffee shop to get coffee. What the hell else would she get at
Page 4: a coffee shop? Condoms? NO. However, there was this cute girl named Sofia. She had a soft-round cute face. One you could fuck all night to.

Now that we have the two main characters in the scene. Let's get to the hot and sexy part. The shower....
Page 5: LLOOL JK WHO HAS SEX IN A SHOWER.

So, the two warmed things up nice and sweet with a shower. Some cute cuddling standing up and fondling tits and washing each other. As they are about to get dirty so I don't know why they didn't save
Page 6: the shower until after. Audrey gets tired after sex don't judge her.

Sofia lays down naked on the bed and Audrey is not slow to lay ontop of Sofia's wet naked body. Sofia and Audrey were both athletes so they had nice hot bodies.
Page 7: Hot too look at, not hot to touch atleast not until they started to fuck.

Things got hot.

The bed sheets melted.

The house caught on fire.

No bodies could be
Page 8: found in the charred remains of their hot, steamy, sexy, sex.

LOL JK that would be horrible. SO let's focus back onto the bed.

Now, I'm sure we all know what happens when to lovely lesbians get together
Page 9: in a bed. So, i'll spare you the details.

I'm sure your head can do the rest of the work. Add some strapons or only use one. Or two. Ten. Kinky shit man. Not litterally. 

The End.

Page 4:      Introduction§0
§0=================== Welcome to potion brewing! If you're new, keep in mind that you need a brewing stand, glass bottles filled with water, and many ingredients, which vary depending on what type of potion you may want to create.
Page 5:      Introduction§0
§0=================== Every brewing stand has the capability to hold at maximum three bottles at a time, meaning you can make 3 potions for every single ingredient you add. Keep this in mind!
Page 6:   Base Ingredients§0
§0=================== These ingredients start all potions.§0
§0------------------- ?Nether Wart§0
§0?Glowstone Dust§0
§0?Redstone§0
§0?Fermented Spider Eye [Adding these to a water bottle will create a base potion. see page 11]
Page 7: Secondary Ingredients =================== ?Magma Creme§0
§0?Sugar§0
§0?Glistering Melon§0
§0?Spider Eye§0
§0?Ghast Tear§0
§0?Blaze Powder§0
§0?Fermented Spider Eye§0
§0?Golden Carrot§0
§0?Pufferfish§0
§0?Rabit's Foot
Page 8:         Modifiers§0

§0[Turns into a splash]§0
§0?Fermented Spider Eye§0
§0[See next page]
Page 9:   Effect Corruption§0
§0=================== Fermented Spider Eyes will change a potion's base effect, often reversing it or producing a negative potion. A "corrupted" potion usually does the opposite of the original potion.
Page 10:       Base Potions§0
§0=================== Base potions, much like base ingredients, are the basis of all potions. These are the potions created by simply a watter bottle and a base ingredient together.

Page 1: If you've experienced survival Minecraft before, you should know what enchanting is. If not, enchanting is a "game of luck" in order to gain buffs on weapons, tools, and armor. In order to enchant, you must acquire an enchantment table and bookshelves.
Page 2: To fully experience the glory of enchanting, you need a total of 1 enchantment table, 20 bookshelves and however many lapis lazuli. To enchant, right-click the enchantment table to open a window. Place in your item, add lapis, pick an enchant, and viola!
Page 3: The luckiest of enchants would most likely be Fortune, this allows you to get more items from what you mined/broke. Another lucky enchant is silk touch, which allows you to pick up spawners and glass without breaking them. Lucky enchants for weapons would
Page 4: be looting, allowing you to get more drops from each mob you kill. Good armor enchants are protection and aqua infinity.

§0===================In the case that you are fired, we will notify you, and give you three days' time (real life days, of course) to vacate your cubicle. You can take anything from the §cinside§0 of your cubicle and chest.

§0===================There is a hopper system set up just outside your office, right on the refreshments table. Toss your book down this hopper and good luck!

   ARTICLE D 12-1
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

    This week in the muttsworld community
we had reports of chickens randomly spawning on players. This occurance has caused question in how the world of minecraft really works.
Page 2:      In further news, Ekip publishing has dominated the market with two popular novels -- "The Name Steve" & "Black Marsh". They have recently announced the publishing of more novels and learning books.

§2   §0One night a woman went out for drinks with her girlfriends. She left the bar fairly late at night, got in her car and onto the deserted highway. After a few minutes she noticed a lone pair of headlights in her rear-view mirror, 
Page 2: approaching at a pace just slightly quicker than hers. As the car pulled up behind her she glanced and saw the turn signal on  the car was going to pass  when suddenly it swerved back behind her, pulled up dangerously close to her tailgate 
Page 3: and the brights flashed. Now she was getting nervous. The lights dimmed for a moment and then the brights came back on and the car behind her surged forward. The frightened woman struggled to keep her eyes on the road and fought 
Page 4: the urge to look at the car behind her. Finally, her exit approached but the car continued to follow, flashing the brights periodically. Through every stoplight and turn, it followed her until she pulled into her driveway.
Page 5: She figured her only hope was to make a mad dash into the house and call the §0police.As§0 she flew from the car, so did the driver of the car behind her  and he screamed, "Lock the door and call the police! Call 911!"
Page 6: When the police arrived the horrible truth was finally revealed to the woman. The man in the car had been trying to save her. As he pulled up behind her and his headlights illuminated her car, 
Page 7: he saw the silhouette of a man with a butcher knife rising up from the back seat to stab her,so he flashed his brights and the figure crouched back down.

§a§l   CHAPTER ONE§0
§0===================It was a cold day. I warmed my gloves by the fire, hoping that perhaps we'd have an extra set of rations tonight. This was a fool's dream, however, and we all knew it.
Page 2: Despite the brutal conditions and heavy casualties, things were starting to look up. We were quick to relax, as we'd been fighting all through the day. Tjaden suffered a cut to the thigh, seemingly caused by a serrated edge.
Page 3: We cringed at the thought of the wound, as Tjaden slept on one of the only three straw beds we had available for the wounded. The rest of us made camp on the floor. Before drifting to sleep, I began thinking of home.
Page 4: This was a mistake of course, as no soldier should ever dream of home, with its high-rolling green meadows, of its warm breeze against their skin. And especially a soldier should never dream of his parents.
Page 5: It's often good to think of home, but never to create such brittle fantasies, such thin memories, as gentle as a spiderweb. It seemed so foreign to me, it's been 3 years since I slept in my own bed, at home.
Page 6: I often missed my dreary existance in civilian life, but I had grown old in the war, despite my young age. §0
§0
§0It was a glorious day, when we signed up...§0
§0
§0What sweet memories that made...
Page 7: 
§a§l   CHAPTER TWO§0
§0===================I had made haste that morning. I had a usual routine of groggily walking down the stairs around noon, when the sun was high in the sky, still rubbing sleep out of my eyes. Today was different.
Page 8: I awoke at approximately 8:00 sharp, readied myself for the day and set off at 8:30. I can remember it so clearly, yet anything else is fogged, as if someone is heavily breathing on the glass of my mind.
Page 9: I met with my friends from school, readying myself for the careful examination of the combat teacher. Tjaden stood at full attention, as if he was born for no reason other than to battle. Bäumer stood at his best ready position, also, but it was apparent 
Page 10: that he was not yet trained. Pünkte and the other recrutes stood on their best behavior, ready for training. I, however did not want to join the military, and it apparently showed.
Page 11: "Hold fast, recruit! What is your name?"§0
§0"Friedrich" I replied sheepishly. I had not anticipated to be called out in this manner. §0
§0"And what is your last name? The one that matters."§0
§0"Uh... Gärtner, sir!"
Page 12: "And why was your reply late, may I ask? Is this truly your name?" He asked, obviously toying with me.§0
§0"Yes, sir!" I replied, embarrassed. He barked at a few of the recruits in an aggressive tone, but after 3 or 4 of us, he gave up.
Page 13: After hours of physical training and marching-drills, we finally got our rest. It was good, there was plenty of food and beer, and everyone was in a jolly mood, having made it past basic selection.
Page 14: 
§a§l CHAPTER THREE§0
§0===================We awoke early for the next 2 months. The same cycle every day. Wake up before dawn had even broken, run drills for 6 hours, eat, and rest soon afterwards.
Page 15: This continued for nearly half a year, with small breaks in between for Christmas and other holidays. It was not so bad, we were only a village away from my home, so on holidays, I would return to visit my family.
Page 16: Eventually the day came. We were given our field-kits. A cheaply-made iron chestplate which made an amusing *klang!* noise when we jumped, a sturdy set of boots, and a tought set of leather pants.
Page 17: The boots were not so bad, in fact they were quite comfortable to wear around the base camp. The chestplates were clearly made on a whim, by some Bavarian factory-worker looking for a quick buck. They'd stop nothing more than a stick.
Page 18: The leggings were the worst of all. It seemed half of our had come from the frontlines, pulled off of dead soldiers. Bäumer's had a clear cut through the knee-cap, with a suspiciously crimson-red stained left leg. We soon decided that it was clearly not
Page 19: a jelly-stain, as the commander had stated. We had to undergo more training while wearing our field-gear and fencing with wooden swords. Two days after recieving our 'armor', our swords arrived.
Page 20: Tjaden was for once the luckiest of the group. His sword was a finely attuned, Swedish made blade. If you had told us that it was forged yesterday, we all well would have believed it. My blade looked worn and used. It was chipped heavily about the
Page 21: hand-guard and lower blade section. A few men traded blades, though it wouldn't matter much. It was based on opinion. We were told that we would move out in 3 days. Of course, when we heard this, we all left soon afterwards to say goodbye to our friends.
Page 22: 
§a§l  CHAPTER FOUR§0
§0=================== The day had come. We arose at 6:30, the commander was generous enough to give us a half hour's more sleep.
Page 23: I grabbed my pack, and we were rationed loaves of bread and tough sausages of pork. We polished off our sausages and saved the bread for later. Most of us, at least.
Page 24: As we were walking, our breast-plates clanking amidst our marching, our mis-matched swords strewn carefully in the sheathes of those fortunate enough to have one on their battle-worn leggings, it became apparent that we were not well prepared.
Page 25: It seemed as though every day, more and more countries joined in on the meaningless war, and that we were the least prepared of all of them. We were told to set up our camp around an open field, amidst a forest. We managed to do so by about sunset.
Page 26: We finished what little stale bread we had, passing our spare to those who had not been so careful with their rations. As I looked around, passing the heel of my loaf to another soldier, I realized that we may have been ill-prepared, but what we lacked
Page 27: in individual equipment, we made up for in numbers. We were only one regiment of the 20 sent onto the field in the past week, and us alone was 120 men strong. This reasurred me, but it was tough to sleep. We were told of an ambush from the
Page 28: French coming tomorrow. We acted to one another as if there would be no such ambush, but inside, we all knew what would meet us in the morning.
Page 29: 
§a§l  CHAPTER FIVE§0
§0=================== We awoke earlier than usual, likely before 5:00 even. It was dark as the night we struggled to sleep in previously.
Page 30: We all looked around, trying to let our eyes adjust. Pünkte came prepared, however. He pulled a torch and a fire-starting kit from his knapsack. He lit the torch, and it went up like a tiny volcano on the end of a stick. We covered our eyes for a few
Page 31: seconds, as it was very bright. §0
§0"You there!" Hollered the commander§0
§0"Snuff that torch! Do you want them to all know where we are?"§0
§0Cursing under his breath, he quickly extinguished the torch in the mud laid below our tent.
Page 32: We sat in silence for quite some time. We could almost see the sun coming up when we hear the yelling of what sounded like 1,000 men. They trampled the ground, and made us tremble.
Page 33: In the cover of darkness, they ran for us, and it was evident as to why they were so loud. Many of them rode on horses, firing arrows towards us at high velocity.
Page 34: A few of our men charged forward, but it was no use; they were quickly struck down by the better-equipped French cavalry. Many of us stood in place, wide-eyed at what was happening, forgetful to what had been mentioned the night before.
Page 35: "Hold your ground!" Yelled our commander. "Let them move to us!" Hollered a recruit from another section of our regiment, whose voice I recognized not. 
Page 36: The French continued their rush towards us, yelling the whole way, and it felt as though time itself came to a halt. We still stood in awe until a French swordsman got close enough to be beheaded by a sergeant from our regiment.
Page 37: We had heard nothing but stories of courage about the war. Nothing but knights in their shining armor, bucking their horse as its mane fluttered in the wind. This was nonsense. When someone is put in a position we were all facing,
Page 38: all emotion is lost. Everything we had trained and trained for had been forgotten. We fought only for ourselves. From the air it must have looked like someone tried to merge oil and water, clear-cut line drawing its way down the battlefield.
Page 39: It continued for long into the afternoon. Five of us stuck together in a group amidst the chaos of the combat. Bäumer, Tjaden, Pünkte and I stood in a close formation, along with another man whose name we did not know.
Page 40: A few squads came rushing towards us, and Tjaden was the first to strike. His blade dug into a man's midriff, and was stuck in his shoulder. I was watching until I was hit across the face with the hilt of a dagger. Bäumer grabbed the man's arm and forced 
Page 41: him to stab himself with his own dagger. I finally snapped out of my shell-shocked surprise, and realised what was happening. Three more men came towards us. I swung at one, but he was quick. He jumped backwards, but unfortunately for him, his friend was
Page 42: close beside with a lashing strike, which dug into his side. He fell with a yelp, his friend's sword buried in him. I was quick on the draw, and swung from the top downward onto the now weaponless man. He tried to dodge, and I hit him in the shoulder. 
Page 43: His arm came clean off, and blood spurted like water from a pump. It was gruesome, but at the time I was fighting for one reason and one reason only: survival. I swung sideways, decapitating him. His head rolled to the floor, as another lunged at me.
Page 44: I barely managed to raise my sword in time to parry his strike, and it was barely effective, to say the least. He stumbled backwards, into Pünkte, who gladly finished him off with a cut to the throat. This type of horrible warfare continued until late in 
Page 45: the evening. At that point, we had all been scattered across the field, finishing off the last of the French with our heavy broadswords. Their cutlasses were no match in an open environment.
Page 46: I hit a man backwards, and he fell under an injured horse. He was trampled in front of my eyes, and I fought the urge to throw up. I turned and looked at the field, now soaked thoroughly in blood. Our band of friends gathered quickly afterwards, stepping
Page 47: over the disfigured corpses. Bäumer had taken a cut to the left arm, one he would live through with no problem. Tjaden and I remained unscathed, at least physically. Pünkte had not been so fortunate. He lay with his eyes open, unblinking, soaked in a pool
Page 48: of his own blood. Many men lay about us in the same fashion, both French and German, but the sight of a dear friend in such a condition was heart-wrenching. Soon afterwards, the commander requested each squad leader take a head-count and report to him.
Page 49: We would have done so, had our leader not been dead. We tallied our squad. What was once 12 men was now a sorry group of 5. The commander came soon with the total. What was once 120 men was now 70. It was not a good day.§0

Page 4:      Introduction§0
§0=================== Welcome to potion brewing! If you're new, keep in mind that you need a brewing stand, glass bottles filled with water, and many ingredients, which vary depending on what type of potion you may want to create.
Page 5:      Introduction§0
§0=================== Every brewing stand has the capability to hold at maximum three bottles at a time, meaning you can make 3 potions for every single ingredient you add. Keep this in mind!
Page 6:   Base Ingredients§0
§0=================== These ingredients start all potions.§0
§0------------------- ?Nether Wart§0
§0?Glowstone Dust§0
§0?Redstone§0
§0?Fermented Spider Eye [Adding these to a water bottle will create a base potion. see page 11]

Page 9:   Effect Corruption§0
§0=================== Fermented Spider Eyes will change a potion's base effect, often reversing it or producing a negative potion. A "corrupted" potion usually does the opposite of the original potion.
Page 10:       Base Potions§0
§0=================== Base potions, much like base ingredients, are the basis of all potions. These are the potions created by simply a watter bottle and a base ingredient together.

§0=================== §0
§0An incredibly basic book for learning simple German phrases. §0
§0
§0   Written by§6 Neskah§0.§0
§0
§0
§0
§3?§0: Ekip Publishings
Page 1: 
§0   §3§lINTRODUCTION§0
§0===================Welcome, reader! In this book, we will be discussing very basic German conversational skills. Please note: This book will §cNOT §0Fully teach you German.
Page 2: §3§l    NON-ENGLISH§0
§3§l      LETTERS§0
§0=================== If you're going to learn German, even basic phrases, there are 4 special characters you have to be aware of. 3 of them are what we call Umlaute. Umlaute are either an A, O, or U with 2 dots.
Page 3: §3ä§0: This character sounds very close to pronouncing the English letter A in the alphabet. (§aAYY§0), although it has less of a twang to it. Instead of pronouncing with a Y sound on the end, try saying "eh?"
Page 4: §3ü§0: With the U umlaut, things get more difficult. Try making an E sound, as in the word §6Me§0. While making this continued EE sound, curve your lips dramatically, like you're kissing someone or making an U sound. 
Page 5: §3ö§0: Like the U umlaut, combine the U sound with an English A. As in the word §6bay§0. While making this A sound, curve your lips, the sound produced should be a U umlaut.§0
§cPlease use Google for this part, it's very difficult to describe on-paper.
Page 6: §3ß§0: This is an Eszet. Make sure not to mistake it for a B, as it's pronounced nothing like it. The eszet is basically a short way to write a double s in German.§0
§0Example:§0
§6Füßen§0, a short way to write §6Füssen§0. §0
§0(§6Feet§0, in English.)
Page 7: A few other things to note about pronounciation of German letters:§0
§0===================§6W§0: Pronounced exactly like an English V.§0
§6V§0: Pronounced exactly like an English F.§0
§6J§0: Pronounced like an English Y. Example:§0
§0Ja = Yah.
Page 8: §6R§0: Google this one, too. It's pronounced very much like a French R, a gutteral sound from the back of your throat.§0
§6Z§0: Pronounced like an English TS. As in Pan§6ts§0. For example, Zehn (ten) is pronounced like Tsayn.
Page 9: Just like in English, groups of letters will make certain sounds together.§0
§6sch§0: Pronounced exactly like an English SH. Example: Tschüss!§0
§0would be pronounced like tshooss. (It's similar to saying Cheers! to a friend.)
Page 10: §6eu§0: Pronounced like an English -oy, as in the word b§6oy§0.§0
§6äu§0: Exactly like the EU, it is pronounced like -oy.§0
§6ie§0: Pronounced like an English ee, as in B§6ee§0.§0
§6ei§0: Pronounced like the English letter I, as in NEIN!
Page 11: §6-ch§0: The infamous flem, like you're coughing up a hairball. I'd recommend Googling this one, too.§0
§6-r§0: When an R comes at the end of a word, like a British accent, it is not pronounced. Example: Besser is pronounced like Bessah.
Page 12: §cth§0: This one is in red because it is NOT pronounced in German like in English. There is not a TH sound (like in the) in German. A TH together is simply pronounced like a T.
Page 13: Keep in mind that silent letters are almost nonexistant in German! Often you will find E's on the end of words, these are pronounced like (uh), like you're thinking about something. (uhhhh)§0
§0Example: Bitte is pronounced bit-tuh
Page 14: Now, on to what you came here for! Phrase-learning!§0

§0These are very simple phrases, that if practiced enough, could come in handy when travelling.

Page 1: §3      Introduction§0
§0===================Welcome to the Ekip Publishing Company! Congratulations on being hired! If you look around in your cubicle, you'll notice there are a few very basic furnishings inside of it.
Page 2: §3      Introduction§0
§0=================== All of these things are now §ayours§0. If you don't like how your cubicle is set up, change it yourself! Every cubicle's floor is 16 blocks. (4x4)
Page 3: §3      Introduction§0
§0===================Do §awhatever you want§0 with your workspace, as long as it does not harm the cubicles of the other workers, the building, or people. Please do note, that your cubicles are only §c4 blocks wide both ways§0.
Page 4: §3      Introduction§0
§0===================Please do note that if you feel like expanding your cubicle, even by a block's worth (§cthis includes changing of the materials on the walls§0) that you will likely be §4fired§0. And in extreme cases, reported.
Page 5: §3      Introduction§0
§0===================In the case that you are fired, we will notify you, and give you three days' time (real life days, of course) to vacate your cubicle. You can take anything from the §cinside§0 of your cubicle and chest.
Page 6: So, now on to what you're all here for: §aMONEY§0! But, how does the Ekip Company pay their employees? It's a bit complicated. If you write a book and choose to submit it to us, a complex system goes to work.
Page 7: Every now and again, the CEOs here at Ekip will have a board meeting. The topic? Book publishers. We will read through the books out loud in a Skype call with everyone in it. 
Page 8: Once the book is read, it will be carefully considered by each individual CEO. Then, we begin to "bid" on your book. Look at it this way, if it was an excellent novel or guide, we'll likely want to pay more for the rights to that book.
Page 9: We'll individually go around and whoever's willing to pay the highest, will get the book. When you're next online we will send you the money for rights to your book, and begin selling it. §6Note: You can deny the offer and take your book back for yourself
Page 10: §cPlease keep in mind that if you submit your book, and we choose to buy it from you, we will consult you about the price, and if you choose to let us publish it, you will lose §c§lall rights to that book.
Page 11: §aAlso note that if your book is accepted, you will recieve a free copy for yourself to keep.§0 §0
§0
§0
§0Let's create a scenario on the next page.
Page 12: I write a book. I think the book could sell very well, so I submit it to the CEOs here at Ekip. They consider it, and accept it, offering to pay me 300 mums for the book's rights. I accept. They pay me the 300 mums, and sign the book. It's no longer mine.
Page 13: §3   How do I submit a        book to the CEOs?§0
§0===================There is a hopper system set up just outside your office, right on the refreshments table. Toss your book down this hopper and good luck!
Page 14: When writing a book, leave the first page §centirely blank§0, with nothing written on it but §cyour name and the title of the book§0. If you don't leave your name, we won't know who to give credit and money to!
Page 15: §4NEVER§0 submit a signed book! Submit the book and quill with nothing written on the first page but your name and the title of the book just below it. If it's accepted, we'll make a title page.
Page 16: If we recieve a signed book or a book with no name, we will return it or at least attempt to return it to its owner.§0

§0
§2   §0One night a woman went out for drinks with her girlfriends. She left the bar fairly late at night, got in her car and onto the deserted highway. After a few minutes she noticed a lone pair of headlights in her rear-view mirror, 
Page 2: approaching at a pace just slightly quicker than hers. As the car pulled up behind her she glanced and saw the turn signal on  the car was going to pass  when suddenly it swerved back behind her, pulled up dangerously close to her tailgate 
Page 3: and the brights flashed. Now she was getting nervous. The lights dimmed for a moment and then the brights came back on and the car behind her surged forward. The frightened woman struggled to keep her eyes on the road and fought 
Page 4: the urge to look at the car behind her. Finally, her exit approached but the car continued to follow, flashing the brights periodically. Through every stoplight and turn, it followed her until she pulled into her driveway.
Page 5: She figured her only hope was to make a mad dash into the house and call the §0police.As§0 she flew from the car, so did the driver of the car behind her  and he screamed, "Lock the door and call the police! Call 911!"
Page 6: When the police arrived the horrible truth was finally revealed to the woman. The man in the car had been trying to save her. As he pulled up behind her and his headlights illuminated her car, 
Page 7: he saw the silhouette of a man with a butcher knife rising up from the back seat to stab her,so he flashed his brights and the figure crouched back down. 
Page 8: The moral of the story: Always check the back seat! §0

	Title: The Name Steve
	Author: jjp1234
	Type: Written

Page 0: Don't ask me what I'm doing here, because I don't know. One day, I woke up in the middle of a forest, covered in snow, devoid of all memory and sense of identity. Why? I have no clue. It almost doesn't matter. I spent the first couple of hours calling for
Page 1: help, wandering around hoping I'd fine someone nearby. After a while, I came to the reluctant conclusion that I was well and truly isolated: no sounds of human voices, no hum of tires on distant roadways; nothing but the trill of far off birds and
Page 2: rustling branches in the wind. There might have been a cow nearby from all the mooing, but I couldn't find it.§0
§0I might not have know who I am, or why I woke up in this snowy forest, but that didn't mean I was going to sit down and let depression take me
Page 3: along with the wolves. I needed a plan of action, need to find a way to survive. But first, a man needs to know himself before he can trust himself, and because my old name was lost to my departed memory. I have decided to call myself Steve. Its a good 
Page 4: name.I spent some time searching the area, looking for anything that might be useful to me. Tools and weapons would be my first priority--don't ask me how I knew, but I could tell the forest would be dangerous at night, I don't know why. There
Page 5: wasn't much, not even a single fallen branch on the ground, just smooth snow and straight pine trees. i tried to grab hold of a few rocks peeking up from the soil,but they were firmly stuck. I'd need something to pry them free, or maybe break them away. I
Page 6: spotted a tree nearby and went to it, running my hands over the dark brown bark. It was a good tree.. strong and healthy.§0
§0
§0So I punched it.§0
§0
§0Pulp and bark flew as my hard fists broke chunk after chunk.
Page 7:  I gritted my teeth against the jarring in my arms and kept going until the whole thing broke through and crashed to the §0ground.Chest§0 heaving from the exertion, I gathered the wood and sat down, examining the pieces. I broke some of the longer chunks into
Page 8: thick sticks, then stabbed on of them into piece of wood shaped like a blade.§0
§0I grinned as I hefted the wooden axe I'd made, then swung it around experimentally. It felt good. I used the axe to fell several more tress until I had enough wood to make all
Page 9: the tools I needed: a shovel, sword and a pickaxe--the latter of which I used to break those stubborn stone from the ground. I stowed the rocks away for later use and strapped the tools to my back. I kept the sword out though, the feeling of danger in the
Page 10: woods tickling the back of my mind. Thus armed, I set off in search of food and shelter.I won't bore you with the details of my struggle against starvation and §0wolves.Suffice§0 it to say, it was a struggle. I fought, bled and conquered. I stumbled over
Page 11: hills and down into water-filled valleys, climbing trees to see the path ahead. I slew cows and ate their flesh to stay alive.I fell off cliffs and broke bones, spending days waiting for them to heal. I briefly marveled at how quickly the wounds mended,
Page 12: but wasted no time in pressing on once they did. At night times, I was attacked by monsters, proving my intuition about the forest to be correct. I hid from the darkness, lighting the small mud huts I'd built along the way with torches until the sim rose
Page 13: once again. I never knew why the world I'd woken up in was filled with skeletons and zombies, but it didn't really matter, I bashed their heads in with stone swords nonetheless. There were more questions to be had than answers, and I knew I would never
Page 14: know half of them.§0
§0
§0I had to SURVIVE!§0
§0
§0Weeks later, exhausted, clothes ripped and torn, blood from numerous cuts on my legs trailing into my socks, I finally found mountains. Majestic. I climbed them each, looking for the ideal spot to build a home
Page 15: far away from the oprressive trees and monster-filled shadows of the forest.I avoided the caves beneath those mountains, fearful of skeletons and massive spiders.I knew I would have to venture inside them eventually, but no then. I finally found a flat
Page 16: topped peak that overlooked the forests to the eats, and the ocean to the west. From its heights, I would be able to see the while land, and defend my homestead from intruders.§0
§0
§0It was good.
Page 17: That was a few months ago. I've since become used to this way of life, in this strange land. The name of Steve fits me like a glove, and I am the master of my modest stone home. I've raised cattle, planted wheat, and baked bread. I've explored those
Page 18: mysterious caved and returned the victor,bringing home coal for fires, iron for tools and armor, precious gold and even a priceless diamond. I am king of all I see, master of this forsaken land And then yesterday, my house blew up.... The building in 
Page 19: peices, the monsters who blew this place to shambles. I gave them a name. I call them§0

§a§l   CHAPTER ONE§0
§0===================It was a cold day. I warmed my gloves by the fire, hoping that perhaps we'd have an extra set of rations tonight. This was a fool's dream, however, and we all knew it.
Page 2: Despite the brutal conditions and heavy casualties, things were starting to look up. We were quick to relax, as we'd been fighting all through the day. Tjaden suffered a cut to the thigh, seemingly caused by a serrated edge.
Page 3: We cringed at the thought of the wound, as Tjaden slept on one of the only three straw beds we had available for the wounded. The rest of us made camp on the floor. Before drifting to sleep, I began thinking of home.
Page 4: This was a mistake of course, as no soldier should ever dream of home, with its high-rolling green meadows, of its warm breeze against their skin. And especially a soldier should never dream of his parents.
Page 5: It's often good to think of home, but never to create such brittle fantasies, such thin memories, as gentle as a spiderweb. It seemed so foreign to me, it's been 3 years since I slept in my own bed, at home.
Page 6: I often missed my dreary existance in civilian life, but I had grown old in the war, despite my young age. §0
§0
§0It was a glorious day, when we signed up...§0
§0
§0What sweet memories that made...
Page 7: 
§a§l   CHAPTER TWO§0
§0===================I had made haste that morning. I had a usual routine of groggily walking down the stairs around noon, when the sun was high in the sky, still rubbing sleep out of my eyes. Today was different.
Page 8: I awoke at approximately 8:00 sharp, readied myself for the day and set off at 8:30. I can remember it so clearly, yet anything else is fogged, as if someone is heavily breathing on the glass of my mind.
Page 9: I met with my friends from school, readying myself for the careful examination of the combat teacher. Tjaden stood at full attention, as if he was born for no reason other than to battle. Bäumer stood at his best ready position, also, but it was apparent 
Page 10: that he was not yet trained. Pünkte and the other recrutes stood on their best behavior, ready for training. I, however did not want to join the military, and it apparently showed.
Page 11: "Hold fast, recruit! What is your name?"§0
§0"Friedrich" I replied sheepishly. I had not anticipated to be called out in this manner. §0
§0"And what is your last name? The one that matters."§0
§0"Uh... Gärtner, sir!"
Page 12: "And why was your reply late, may I ask? Is this truly your name?" He asked, obviously toying with me.§0
§0"Yes, sir!" I replied, embarrassed. He barked at a few of the recruits in an aggressive tone, but after 3 or 4 of us, he gave up.
Page 13: After hours of physical training and marching-drills, we finally got our rest. It was good, there was plenty of food and beer, and everyone was in a jolly mood, having made it past basic selection.
Page 14: 
§a§l CHAPTER THREE§0
§0===================We awoke early for the next 2 months. The same cycle every day. Wake up before dawn had even broken, run drills for 6 hours, eat, and rest soon afterwards.
Page 15: This continued for nearly half a year, with small breaks in between for Christmas and other holidays. It was not so bad, we were only a village away from my home, so on holidays, I would return to visit my family.
Page 16: Eventually the day came. We were given our field-kits. A cheaply-made iron chestplate which made an amusing *klang!* noise when we jumped, a sturdy set of boots, and a tought set of leather pants.
Page 17: The boots were not so bad, in fact they were quite comfortable to wear around the base camp. The chestplates were clearly made on a whim, by some Bavarian factory-worker looking for a quick buck. They'd stop nothing more than a stick.
Page 18: The leggings were the worst of all. It seemed half of our had come from the frontlines, pulled off of dead soldiers. Bäumer's had a clear cut through the knee-cap, with a suspiciously crimson-red stained left leg. We soon decided that it was clearly not
Page 19: a jelly-stain, as the commander had stated. We had to undergo more training while wearing our field-gear and fencing with wooden swords. Two days after recieving our 'armor', our swords arrived.
Page 20: Tjaden was for once the luckiest of the group. His sword was a finely attuned, Swedish made blade. If you had told us that it was forged yesterday, we all well would have believed it. My blade looked worn and used. It was chipped heavily about the
Page 21: hand-guard and lower blade section. A few men traded blades, though it wouldn't matter much. It was based on opinion. We were told that we would move out in 3 days. Of course, when we heard this, we all left soon afterwards to say goodbye to our friends.
Page 22: 
§a§l  CHAPTER FOUR§0
§0=================== The day had come. We arose at 6:30, the commander was generous enough to give us a half hour's more sleep.
Page 23: I grabbed my pack, and we were rationed loaves of bread and tough sausages of pork. We polished off our sausages and saved the bread for later. Most of us, at least.
Page 24: As we were walking, our breast-plates clanking amidst our marching, our mis-matched swords strewn carefully in the sheathes of those fortunate enough to have one on their battle-worn leggings, it became apparent that we were not well prepared.
Page 25: It seemed as though every day, more and more countries joined in on the meaningless war, and that we were the least prepared of all of them. We were told to set up our camp around an open field, amidst a forest. We managed to do so by about sunset.
Page 26: We finished what little stale bread we had, passing our spare to those who had not been so careful with their rations. As I looked around, passing the heel of my loaf to another soldier, I realized that we may have been ill-prepared, but what we lacked
Page 27: in individual equipment, we made up for in numbers. We were only one regiment of the 20 sent onto the field in the past week, and us alone was 120 men strong. This reasurred me, but it was tough to sleep. We were told of an ambush from the
Page 28: French coming tomorrow. We acted to one another as if there would be no such ambush, but inside, we all knew what would meet us in the morning.
Page 29: 
§a§l  CHAPTER FIVE§0
§0=================== We awoke earlier than usual, likely before 5:00 even. It was dark as the night we struggled to sleep in previously.
Page 30: We all looked around, trying to let our eyes adjust. Pünkte came prepared, however. He pulled a torch and a fire-starting kit from his knapsack. He lit the torch, and it went up like a tiny volcano on the end of a stick. We covered our eyes for a few
Page 31: seconds, as it was very bright. §0
§0"You there!" Hollered the commander§0
§0"Snuff that torch! Do you want them to all know where we are?"§0
§0Cursing under his breath, he quickly extinguished the torch in the mud laid below our tent.
Page 32: We sat in silence for quite some time. We could almost see the sun coming up when we hear the yelling of what sounded like 1,000 men. They trampled the ground, and made us tremble.
Page 33: In the cover of darkness, they ran for us, and it was evident as to why they were so loud. Many of them rode on horses, firing arrows towards us at high velocity.
Page 34: A few of our men charged forward, but it was no use; they were quickly struck down by the better-equipped French cavalry. Many of us stood in place, wide-eyed at what was happening, forgetful to what had been mentioned the night before.
Page 35: "Hold your ground!" Yelled our commander. "Let them move to us!" Hollered a recruit from another section of our regiment, whose voice I recognized not. 
Page 36: The French continued their rush towards us, yelling the whole way, and it felt as though time itself came to a halt. We still stood in awe until a French swordsman got close enough to be beheaded by a sergeant from our regiment.
Page 37: We had heard nothing but stories of courage about the war. Nothing but knights in their shining armor, bucking their horse as its mane fluttered in the wind. This was nonsense. When someone is put in a position we were all facing,
Page 38: all emotion is lost. Everything we had trained and trained for had been forgotten. We fought only for ourselves. From the air it must have looked like someone tried to merge oil and water, clear-cut line drawing its way down the battlefield.
Page 39: It continued for long into the afternoon. Five of us stuck together in a group amidst the chaos of the combat. Bäumer, Tjaden, Pünkte and I stood in a close formation, along with another man whose name we did not know.
Page 40: A few squads came rushing towards us, and Tjaden was the first to strike. His blade dug into a man's midriff, and was stuck in his shoulder. I was watching until I was hit across the face with the hilt of a dagger. Bäumer grabbed the man's arm and forced 
Page 41: him to stab himself with his own dagger. I finally snapped out of my shell-shocked surprise, and realised what was happening. Three more men came towards us. I swung at one, but he was quick. He jumped backwards, but unfortunately for him, his friend was
Page 42: close beside with a lashing strike, which dug into his side. He fell with a yelp, his friend's sword buried in him. I was quick on the draw, and swung from the top downward onto the now weaponless man. He tried to dodge, and I hit him in the shoulder. 
Page 43: His arm came clean off, and blood spurted like water from a pump. It was gruesome, but at the time I was fighting for one reason and one reason only: survival. I swung sideways, decapitating him. His head rolled to the floor, as another lunged at me.
Page 44: I barely managed to raise my sword in time to parry his strike, and it was barely effective, to say the least. He stumbled backwards, into Pünkte, who gladly finished him off with a cut to the throat. This type of horrible warfare continued until late in 
Page 45: the evening. At that point, we had all been scattered across the field, finishing off the last of the French with our heavy broadswords. Their cutlasses were no match in an open environment.
Page 46: I hit a man backwards, and he fell under an injured horse. He was trampled in front of my eyes, and I fought the urge to throw up. I turned and looked at the field, now soaked thoroughly in blood. Our band of friends gathered quickly afterwards, stepping
Page 47: over the disfigured corpses. Bäumer had taken a cut to the left arm, one he would live through with no problem. Tjaden and I remained unscathed, at least physically. Pünkte had not been so fortunate. He lay with his eyes open, unblinking, soaked in a pool
Page 48: of his own blood. Many men lay about us in the same fashion, both French and German, but the sight of a dear friend in such a condition was heart-wrenching. Soon afterwards, the commander requested each squad leader take a head-count and report to him.
Page 49: We would have done so, had our leader not been dead. We tallied our squad. What was once 12 men was now a sorry group of 5. The commander came soon with the total. What was once 120 men was now 70. It was not a good day.§0

Page 1:  Toward the end of the 1940s, Soviet researchers sealed five prison inmates in an airtight chamber and dosed them with an experimental stimulant gas to test the effects of prolonged sleep deprivation. 
Page 2: Their behavior was observed via two-way mirrors and their conversations monitored electronically. They had been promised their freedom if they could go entirely without sleep for 30 days.
Page 3: The first few days of the experiment passed uneventfully. By the fifth day, however, the subjects began showing signs of stress and were overheard bemoaning their circumstances. 
Page 4: hey stopped conversing with their fellow inmates, choosing instead to whisper compromising information about one another into the microphones, apparently in an effort to win the favor of the researchers. 
Page 5: Paranoia set §0in.On§0 the ninth day the screaming began. First one subject, then another, was observed running around the chamber screaming at the top of his lungs for hours on end. 
Page 6: Equally disconcerting was the reaction of the quieter subjects, who began ripping apart the books they'd been given to read, smearing the pages with feces, and plastering them over the mirrored windows so their actions could no longer be observed.
Page 7: Just as suddenly, the screaming stopped. The subjects ceased communicating altogether. Three long days passed without a sound from inside the §0chamber.Fearing§0 the worst, the researchers addressed the subjects via the intercom.
Page 8: We are opening the chamber to test the microphones," they said. "Step away from the door and lie flat on the floor or you will be shot. Compliance will earn one of you your immediate freedom."A voice from inside answered, We no longer want to be freed."
Page 9: Two more days passed without contact of any kind as the scientists debated what to do next. Finally, they decided to terminate the experiment.
Page 10: At midnight on the fifteenth day the stimulant gas was flushed from the chamber and replaced with fresh air in preparation for the subjects' release.
Page 11: Far from being pleased at the prospect of leaving the chamber, the subjects began screaming as if in fear for their §0lives.They§0 begged to have the gas turned back on. Instead,the researchers unsealed the door to the
Page 12: chamber and sent armed soldiers inside to retrieve them. Nothing could have prepared them for the carnage they witnessed upon entering. One subject was found dead, lying face-down in sixinches of bloody water. Chunks of his
Page 13: flesh had been torn off and stuffed into the floor drain. All of the test subjects were found to have been severely mutilated, in fact. What's worse, the wounds appeared to be self-inflicted.
Page 14: They had ripped open their own abdomens and disemboweled themselves with their bare hands. Some had even eaten their own flesh. The four who were still alive seemed terrified of falling asleep and refused to leave the chamber, again pleading
Page 15: with the researchers to turn the gas back on. When the soldiers attempted to remove the inmates by force, they fought back so ferociously they couldn't believe their eyes. One suffered a ruptured spleen and lost so much blood 
Page 16: there was literally nothing left for his heart to pump, yet continued flailing for a full three minutes until his lifeless body collapsed. The remaining subjects were restrained and transported to a medical facility for treatment. 
Page 17: The first to be operated on fought so furiously against being anesthetized that he tore muscles and broke bones during the struggle. As soon as the anesthetic took effect his heart stopped and he died. The rest underwent surgery without sedation.
Page 18: Far from feeling any pain, however, they laughed hysterically on the operating table -- so hysterically that the doctors, perhaps fearing for their own sanity, administered a paralytic agent to immobilize them. After surgery the survivors were asked why 
Page 19: they had mutilated themselves, and why they so desperately wanted to go back on the stimulant gas. Each, in turn, gave the same answer: "I must remain awake."The researchers considered euthanizing them to obliterate every trace of the failed 
Page 20: experiment, but were overruled by their commanding officer, who ordered that it be resumed immediately, with three of the researchers joining the inmates in the sealed chamber. Horrified at the prospect, 
Page 21: the chief researcher pulled out a pistol and shot the commanding officer point blank. He then turned and shot one of the two surviving subjects. Pointing his gun at the last one left alive, he asked, What are you? I must know!"
Page 22: "Have you forgotten so easily?" the subject said, smiling. We are you. We are the madness that lurks within you all, begging to be free at every moment in your deepest animal mind. We are what you hide from in your beds every night.
Page 23: We are what you sedate into silence and paralysis when you go to the nocturnal haven where we cannot tread."
Page 24: The researcher fired a bullet into his heart. The EEG monitor flatlined as the subject murmured these last words: "§0So...nearly...free."§0

Page 4:      Introduction§0
§0=================== Welcome to potion brewing! If you're new, keep in mind that you need a brewing stand, glass bottles filled with water, and many ingredients, which vary depending on what type of potion you may want to create.
Page 5:      Introduction§0
§0=================== Every brewing stand has the capability to hold at maximum three bottles at a time, meaning you can make 3 potions for every single ingredient you add. Keep this in mind!
Page 6:   Base Ingredients§0
§0=================== These ingredients start all potions.§0

§0=================== Fermented Spider Eyes will change a potion's base effect, often reversing it or producing a negative potion. A "corrupted" potion usually does the opposite of the original potion.
Page 10:       Base Potions§0
§0=================== Base potions, much like base ingredients, are the basis of all potions. These are the potions created by simply a watter bottle and a base ingredient together.

§a§l LERNEN DEUTSCH§0
§0=================== §0
§0An incredibly basic book for learning simple German phrases. §0

Page 1: 
§0   §3§lINTRODUCTION§0
§0===================Welcome, reader! In this book, we will be discussing very basic German conversational skills. Please note: This book will §cNOT §0Fully teach you German.
Page 2: §3§l    NON-ENGLISH§0
§3§l      LETTERS§0
§0=================== If you're going to learn German, even basic phrases, there are 4 special characters you have to be aware of. 3 of them are what we call Umlaute. Umlaute are either an A, O, or U with 2 dots.
Page 3: §3ä§0: This character sounds very close to pronouncing the English letter A in the alphabet. (§aAYY§0), although it has less of a twang to it. Instead of pronouncing with a Y sound on the end, try saying "eh?"
Page 4: §3ü§0: With the U umlaut, things get more difficult. Try making an E sound, as in the word §6Me§0. While making this continued EE sound, curve your lips dramatically, like you're kissing someone or making an U sound. 
Page 5: §3ö§0: Like the U umlaut, combine the U sound with an English A. As in the word §6bay§0. While making this A sound, curve your lips, the sound produced should be a U umlaut.§0
§cPlease use Google for this part, it's very difficult to describe on-paper.
Page 6: §3ß§0: This is an Eszet. Make sure not to mistake it for a B, as it's pronounced nothing like it. The eszet is basically a short way to write a double s in German.§0
§0Example:§0
§6Füßen§0, a short way to write §6Füssen§0. §0
§0(§6Feet§0, in English.)
Page 7: A few other things to note about pronounciation of German letters:§0
§0===================§6W§0: Pronounced exactly like an English V.§0
§6V§0: Pronounced exactly like an English F.§0
§6J§0: Pronounced like an English Y. Example:§0
§0Ja = Yah.
Page 8: §6R§0: Google this one, too. It's pronounced very much like a French R, a gutteral sound from the back of your throat.§0
§6Z§0: Pronounced like an English TS. As in Pan§6ts§0. For example, Zehn (ten) is pronounced like Tsayn.
Page 9: Just like in English, groups of letters will make certain sounds together.§0
§6sch§0: Pronounced exactly like an English SH. Example: Tschüss!§0
§0would be pronounced like tshooss. (It's similar to saying Cheers! to a friend.)
Page 10: §6eu§0: Pronounced like an English -oy, as in the word b§6oy§0.§0
§6äu§0: Exactly like the EU, it is pronounced like -oy.§0
§6ie§0: Pronounced like an English ee, as in B§6ee§0.§0
§6ei§0: Pronounced like the English letter I, as in NEIN!
Page 11: §6-ch§0: The infamous flem, like you're coughing up a hairball. I'd recommend Googling this one, too.§0
§6-r§0: When an R comes at the end of a word, like a British accent, it is not pronounced. Example: Besser is pronounced like Bessah.
Page 12: §cth§0: This one is in red because it is NOT pronounced in German like in English. There is not a TH sound (like in the) in German. A TH together is simply pronounced like a T.
Page 13: Keep in mind that silent letters are almost nonexistant in German! Often you will find E's on the end of words, these are pronounced like (uh), like you're thinking about something. (uhhhh)§0
§0Example: Bitte is pronounced bit-tuh

§0===================Welcome to the Ekip Publishing Company! Congratulations on being hired! If you look around in your cubicle, you'll notice there are a few very basic furnishings inside of it.
Page 2: §3      Introduction§0
§0=================== All of these things are now §ayours§0. If you don't like how your cubicle is set up, change it yourself! Every cubicle's floor is 16 blocks. (4x4)
Page 3: §3      Introduction§0
§0===================Do §awhatever you want§0 with your workspace, as long as it does not harm the cubicles of the other workers, the building, or people. Please do note, that your cubicles are only §c4 blocks wide both ways§0.
Page 4: §3      Introduction§0
§0===================Please do note that if you feel like expanding your cubicle, even by a block's worth (§cthis includes changing of the materials on the walls§0) that you will likely be §4fired§0. And in extreme cases, reported.
Page 5: §3      Introduction§0
§0===================In the case that you are fired, we will notify you, and give you three days' time (real life days, of course) to vacate your cubicle. You can take anything from the §cinside§0 of your cubicle and chest.
Page 6: So, now on to what you're all here for: §aMONEY§0! But, how does the Ekip Company pay their employees? It's a bit complicated. If you write a book and choose to submit it to us, a complex system goes to work.
Page 7: Every now and again, the CEOs here at Ekip will have a board meeting. The topic? Book publishers. We will read through the books out loud in a Skype call with everyone in it. 
Page 8: Once the book is read, it will be carefully considered by each individual CEO. Then, we begin to "bid" on your book. Look at it this way, if it was an excellent novel or guide, we'll likely want to pay more for the rights to that book.
Page 9: We'll individually go around and whoever's willing to pay the highest, will get the book. When you're next online we will send you the money for rights to your book, and begin selling it. §6Note: You can deny the offer and take your book back for yourself
Page 10: §cPlease keep in mind that if you submit your book, and we choose to buy it from you, we will consult you about the price, and if you choose to let us publish it, you will lose §c§lall rights to that book.
Page 11: §aAlso note that if your book is accepted, you will recieve a free copy for yourself to keep.§0 §0
§0
§0
§0Let's create a scenario on the next page.
Page 12: I write a book. I think the book could sell very well, so I submit it to the CEOs here at Ekip. They consider it, and accept it, offering to pay me 300 mums for the book's rights. I accept. They pay me the 300 mums, and sign the book. It's no longer mine.
Page 13: §3   How do I submit a        book to the CEOs?§0
§0===================There is a hopper system set up just outside your office, right on the refreshments table. Toss your book down this hopper and good luck!
Page 14: When writing a book, leave the first page §centirely blank§0, with nothing written on it but §cyour name and the title of the book§0. If you don't leave your name, we won't know who to give credit and money to!
Page 15: §4NEVER§0 submit a signed book! Submit the book and quill with nothing written on the first page but your name and the title of the book just below it. If it's accepted, we'll make a title page.

§a§l   CHAPTER ONE§0
§0===================It was a cold day. I warmed my gloves by the fire, hoping that perhaps we'd have an extra set of rations tonight. This was a fool's dream, however, and we all knew it.
Page 2: Despite the brutal conditions and heavy casualties, things were starting to look up. We were quick to relax, as we'd been fighting all through the day. Tjaden suffered a cut to the thigh, seemingly caused by a serrated edge.
Page 3: We cringed at the thought of the wound, as Tjaden slept on one of the only three straw beds we had available for the wounded. The rest of us made camp on the floor. Before drifting to sleep, I began thinking of home.
Page 4: This was a mistake of course, as no soldier should ever dream of home, with its high-rolling green meadows, of its warm breeze against their skin. And especially a soldier should never dream of his parents.
Page 5: It's often good to think of home, but never to create such brittle fantasies, such thin memories, as gentle as a spiderweb. It seemed so foreign to me, it's been 3 years since I slept in my own bed, at home.
Page 6: I often missed my dreary existance in civilian life, but I had grown old in the war, despite my young age. §0
§0
§0It was a glorious day, when we signed up...§0
§0
§0What sweet memories that made...
Page 7: 
§a§l   CHAPTER TWO§0
§0===================I had made haste that morning. I had a usual routine of groggily walking down the stairs around noon, when the sun was high in the sky, still rubbing sleep out of my eyes. Today was different.
Page 8: I awoke at approximately 8:00 sharp, readied myself for the day and set off at 8:30. I can remember it so clearly, yet anything else is fogged, as if someone is heavily breathing on the glass of my mind.
Page 9: I met with my friends from school, readying myself for the careful examination of the combat teacher. Tjaden stood at full attention, as if he was born for no reason other than to battle. Bäumer stood at his best ready position, also, but it was apparent 
Page 10: that he was not yet trained. Pünkte and the other recrutes stood on their best behavior, ready for training. I, however did not want to join the military, and it apparently showed.
Page 11: "Hold fast, recruit! What is your name?"§0
§0"Friedrich" I replied sheepishly. I had not anticipated to be called out in this manner. §0
§0"And what is your last name? The one that matters."§0
§0"Uh... Gärtner, sir!"
Page 12: "And why was your reply late, may I ask? Is this truly your name?" He asked, obviously toying with me.§0
§0"Yes, sir!" I replied, embarrassed. He barked at a few of the recruits in an aggressive tone, but after 3 or 4 of us, he gave up.
Page 13: After hours of physical training and marching-drills, we finally got our rest. It was good, there was plenty of food and beer, and everyone was in a jolly mood, having made it past basic selection.
Page 14: 
§a§l CHAPTER THREE§0
§0===================We awoke early for the next 2 months. The same cycle every day. Wake up before dawn had even broken, run drills for 6 hours, eat, and rest soon afterwards.
Page 15: This continued for nearly half a year, with small breaks in between for Christmas and other holidays. It was not so bad, we were only a village away from my home, so on holidays, I would return to visit my family.
Page 16: Eventually the day came. We were given our field-kits. A cheaply-made iron chestplate which made an amusing *klang!* noise when we jumped, a sturdy set of boots, and a tought set of leather pants.
Page 17: The boots were not so bad, in fact they were quite comfortable to wear around the base camp. The chestplates were clearly made on a whim, by some Bavarian factory-worker looking for a quick buck. They'd stop nothing more than a stick.
Page 18: The leggings were the worst of all. It seemed half of our had come from the frontlines, pulled off of dead soldiers. Bäumer's had a clear cut through the knee-cap, with a suspiciously crimson-red stained left leg. We soon decided that it was clearly not
Page 19: a jelly-stain, as the commander had stated. We had to undergo more training while wearing our field-gear and fencing with wooden swords. Two days after recieving our 'armor', our swords arrived.
Page 20: Tjaden was for once the luckiest of the group. His sword was a finely attuned, Swedish made blade. If you had told us that it was forged yesterday, we all well would have believed it. My blade looked worn and used. It was chipped heavily about the
Page 21: hand-guard and lower blade section. A few men traded blades, though it wouldn't matter much. It was based on opinion. We were told that we would move out in 3 days. Of course, when we heard this, we all left soon afterwards to say goodbye to our friends.
Page 22: 
§a§l  CHAPTER FOUR§0
§0=================== The day had come. We arose at 6:30, the commander was generous enough to give us a half hour's more sleep.
Page 23: I grabbed my pack, and we were rationed loaves of bread and tough sausages of pork. We polished off our sausages and saved the bread for later. Most of us, at least.
Page 24: As we were walking, our breast-plates clanking amidst our marching, our mis-matched swords strewn carefully in the sheathes of those fortunate enough to have one on their battle-worn leggings, it became apparent that we were not well prepared.
Page 25: It seemed as though every day, more and more countries joined in on the meaningless war, and that we were the least prepared of all of them. We were told to set up our camp around an open field, amidst a forest. We managed to do so by about sunset.
Page 26: We finished what little stale bread we had, passing our spare to those who had not been so careful with their rations. As I looked around, passing the heel of my loaf to another soldier, I realized that we may have been ill-prepared, but what we lacked
Page 27: in individual equipment, we made up for in numbers. We were only one regiment of the 20 sent onto the field in the past week, and us alone was 120 men strong. This reasurred me, but it was tough to sleep. We were told of an ambush from the
Page 28: French coming tomorrow. We acted to one another as if there would be no such ambush, but inside, we all knew what would meet us in the morning.
Page 29: 
§a§l  CHAPTER FIVE§0
§0=================== We awoke earlier than usual, likely before 5:00 even. It was dark as the night we struggled to sleep in previously.
Page 30: We all looked around, trying to let our eyes adjust. Pünkte came prepared, however. He pulled a torch and a fire-starting kit from his knapsack. He lit the torch, and it went up like a tiny volcano on the end of a stick. We covered our eyes for a few
Page 31: seconds, as it was very bright. §0
§0"You there!" Hollered the commander§0
§0"Snuff that torch! Do you want them to all know where we are?"§0
§0Cursing under his breath, he quickly extinguished the torch in the mud laid below our tent.
Page 32: We sat in silence for quite some time. We could almost see the sun coming up when we hear the yelling of what sounded like 1,000 men. They trampled the ground, and made us tremble.
Page 33: In the cover of darkness, they ran for us, and it was evident as to why they were so loud. Many of them rode on horses, firing arrows towards us at high velocity.
Page 34: A few of our men charged forward, but it was no use; they were quickly struck down by the better-equipped French cavalry. Many of us stood in place, wide-eyed at what was happening, forgetful to what had been mentioned the night before.
Page 35: "Hold your ground!" Yelled our commander. "Let them move to us!" Hollered a recruit from another section of our regiment, whose voice I recognized not. 
Page 36: The French continued their rush towards us, yelling the whole way, and it felt as though time itself came to a halt. We still stood in awe until a French swordsman got close enough to be beheaded by a sergeant from our regiment.
Page 37: We had heard nothing but stories of courage about the war. Nothing but knights in their shining armor, bucking their horse as its mane fluttered in the wind. This was nonsense. When someone is put in a position we were all facing,
Page 38: all emotion is lost. Everything we had trained and trained for had been forgotten. We fought only for ourselves. From the air it must have looked like someone tried to merge oil and water, clear-cut line drawing its way down the battlefield.
Page 39: It continued for long into the afternoon. Five of us stuck together in a group amidst the chaos of the combat. Bäumer, Tjaden, Pünkte and I stood in a close formation, along with another man whose name we did not know.
Page 40: A few squads came rushing towards us, and Tjaden was the first to strike. His blade dug into a man's midriff, and was stuck in his shoulder. I was watching until I was hit across the face with the hilt of a dagger. Bäumer grabbed the man's arm and forced 
Page 41: him to stab himself with his own dagger. I finally snapped out of my shell-shocked surprise, and realised what was happening. Three more men came towards us. I swung at one, but he was quick. He jumped backwards, but unfortunately for him, his friend was
Page 42: close beside with a lashing strike, which dug into his side. He fell with a yelp, his friend's sword buried in him. I was quick on the draw, and swung from the top downward onto the now weaponless man. He tried to dodge, and I hit him in the shoulder. 
Page 43: His arm came clean off, and blood spurted like water from a pump. It was gruesome, but at the time I was fighting for one reason and one reason only: survival. I swung sideways, decapitating him. His head rolled to the floor, as another lunged at me.
Page 44: I barely managed to raise my sword in time to parry his strike, and it was barely effective, to say the least. He stumbled backwards, into Pünkte, who gladly finished him off with a cut to the throat. This type of horrible warfare continued until late in 
Page 45: the evening. At that point, we had all been scattered across the field, finishing off the last of the French with our heavy broadswords. Their cutlasses were no match in an open environment.
Page 46: I hit a man backwards, and he fell under an injured horse. He was trampled in front of my eyes, and I fought the urge to throw up. I turned and looked at the field, now soaked thoroughly in blood. Our band of friends gathered quickly afterwards, stepping
Page 47: over the disfigured corpses. Bäumer had taken a cut to the left arm, one he would live through with no problem. Tjaden and I remained unscathed, at least physically. Pünkte had not been so fortunate. He lay with his eyes open, unblinking, soaked in a pool
Page 48: of his own blood. Many men lay about us in the same fashion, both French and German, but the sight of a dear friend in such a condition was heart-wrenching. Soon afterwards, the commander requested each squad leader take a head-count and report to him.
Page 49: We would have done so, had our leader not been dead. We tallied our squad. What was once 12 men was now a sorry group of 5. The commander came soon with the total. What was once 120 men was now 70. It was not a good day.§0

Page 4:      Introduction§0
§0=================== Welcome to potion brewing! If you're new, keep in mind that you need a brewing stand, glass bottles filled with water, and many ingredients, which vary depending on what type of potion you may want to create.
Page 5:      Introduction§0
§0=================== Every brewing stand has the capability to hold at maximum three bottles at a time, meaning you can make 3 potions for every single ingredient you add. Keep this in mind!
Page 6:   Base Ingredients§0
§0=================== These ingredients start all potions.§0
§0------------------- ?Nether Wart§0
§0?Glowstone Dust§0
§0?Redstone§0
§0?Fermented Spider Eye [Adding these to a water bottle will create a base potion. see page 11]
Page 7: Secondary Ingredients =================== ?Magma Creme§0
§0?Sugar§0
§0?Glistering Melon§0
§0?Spider Eye§0
§0?Ghast Tear§0
§0?Blaze Powder§0
§0?Fermented Spider Eye§0
§0?Golden Carrot§0
§0?Pufferfish§0
§0?Rabit's Foot
Page 8:         Modifiers§0
§0=================== Add these to a potion to alter their effects. -------------------?Redstone§0

§0?Glowstone Dust§0
§0[Increases potency]§0
§0?Gunpowder§0
§0[Turns into a splash]§0
§0?Fermented Spider Eye§0
§0[See next page]
Page 9:   Effect Corruption§0
§0=================== Fermented Spider Eyes will change a potion's base effect, often reversing it or producing a negative potion. A "corrupted" potion usually does the opposite of the original potion.
Page 10:       Base Potions§0
§0=================== Base potions, much like base ingredients, are the basis of all potions. These are the potions created by simply a watter bottle and a base ingredient together.

	Title: The Name Steve
	Author: jjp1234
	Type: Written

Page 0: Don't ask me what I'm doing here, because I don't know. One day, I woke up in the middle of a forest, covered in snow, devoid of all memory and sense of identity. Why? I have no clue. It almost doesn't matter. I spent the first couple of hours calling for
Page 1: help, wandering around hoping I'd fine someone nearby. After a while, I came to the reluctant conclusion that I was well and truly isolated: no sounds of human voices, no hum of tires on distant roadways; nothing but the trill of far off birds and
Page 2: rustling branches in the wind. There might have been a cow nearby from all the mooing, but I couldn't find it.§0
§0I might not have know who I am, or why I woke up in this snowy forest, but that didn't mean I was going to sit down and let depression take me
Page 3: along with the wolves. I needed a plan of action, need to find a way to survive. But first, a man needs to know himself before he can trust himself, and because my old name was lost to my departed memory. I have decided to call myself Steve. Its a good 
Page 4: name.I spent some time searching the area, looking for anything that might be useful to me. Tools and weapons would be my first priority--don't ask me how I knew, but I could tell the forest would be dangerous at night, I don't know why. There
Page 5: wasn't much, not even a single fallen branch on the ground, just smooth snow and straight pine trees. i tried to grab hold of a few rocks peeking up from the soil,but they were firmly stuck. I'd need something to pry them free, or maybe break them away. I
Page 6: spotted a tree nearby and went to it, running my hands over the dark brown bark. It was a good tree.. strong and healthy.§0
§0
§0So I punched it.§0
§0
§0Pulp and bark flew as my hard fists broke chunk after chunk.
Page 7:  I gritted my teeth against the jarring in my arms and kept going until the whole thing broke through and crashed to the §0ground.Chest§0 heaving from the exertion, I gathered the wood and sat down, examining the pieces. I broke some of the longer chunks into
Page 8: thick sticks, then stabbed on of them into piece of wood shaped like a blade.§0
§0I grinned as I hefted the wooden axe I'd made, then swung it around experimentally. It felt good. I used the axe to fell several more tress until I had enough wood to make all
Page 9: the tools I needed: a shovel, sword and a pickaxe--the latter of which I used to break those stubborn stone from the ground. I stowed the rocks away for later use and strapped the tools to my back. I kept the sword out though, the feeling of danger in the
Page 10: woods tickling the back of my mind. Thus armed, I set off in search of food and shelter.I won't bore you with the details of my struggle against starvation and §0wolves.Suffice§0 it to say, it was a struggle. I fought, bled and conquered. I stumbled over
Page 11: hills and down into water-filled valleys, climbing trees to see the path ahead. I slew cows and ate their flesh to stay alive.I fell off cliffs and broke bones, spending days waiting for them to heal. I briefly marveled at how quickly the wounds mended,
Page 12: but wasted no time in pressing on once they did. At night times, I was attacked by monsters, proving my intuition about the forest to be correct. I hid from the darkness, lighting the small mud huts I'd built along the way with torches until the sim rose
Page 13: once again. I never knew why the world I'd woken up in was filled with skeletons and zombies, but it didn't really matter, I bashed their heads in with stone swords nonetheless. There were more questions to be had than answers, and I knew I would never
Page 14: know half of them.§0
§0
§0I had to SURVIVE!§0
§0
§0Weeks later, exhausted, clothes ripped and torn, blood from numerous cuts on my legs trailing into my socks, I finally found mountains. Majestic. I climbed them each, looking for the ideal spot to build a home
Page 15: far away from the oprressive trees and monster-filled shadows of the forest.I avoided the caves beneath those mountains, fearful of skeletons and massive spiders.I knew I would have to venture inside them eventually, but no then. I finally found a flat
Page 16: topped peak that overlooked the forests to the eats, and the ocean to the west. From its heights, I would be able to see the while land, and defend my homestead from intruders.§0
§0
§0It was good.
Page 17: That was a few months ago. I've since become used to this way of life, in this strange land. The name of Steve fits me like a glove, and I am the master of my modest stone home. I've raised cattle, planted wheat, and baked bread. I've explored those
Page 18: mysterious caved and returned the victor,bringing home coal for fires, iron for tools and armor, precious gold and even a priceless diamond. I am king of all I see, master of this forsaken land And then yesterday, my house blew up.... The building in 
Page 19: peices, the monsters who blew this place to shambles. I gave them a name. I call them§0

Page 0:    Wilkommen nach§0
§a§l LERNEN DEUTSCH§0
§0=================== §0
§0An incredibly basic book for learning simple German phrases. §0
§0
§0   Written by§6 Neskah§0.§0
§0
§0
§0
§3?§0: Ekip Publishings
Page 1: 
§0   §3§lINTRODUCTION§0
§0===================Welcome, reader! In this book, we will be discussing very basic German conversational skills. Please note: This book will §cNOT §0Fully teach you German.
Page 2: §3§l    NON-ENGLISH§0
§3§l      LETTERS§0
§0=================== If you're going to learn German, even basic phrases, there are 4 special characters you have to be aware of. 3 of them are what we call Umlaute. Umlaute are either an A, O, or U with 2 dots.
Page 3: §3ä§0: This character sounds very close to pronouncing the English letter A in the alphabet. (§aAYY§0), although it has less of a twang to it. Instead of pronouncing with a Y sound on the end, try saying "eh?"
Page 4: §3ü§0: With the U umlaut, things get more difficult. Try making an E sound, as in the word §6Me§0. While making this continued EE sound, curve your lips dramatically, like you're kissing someone or making an U sound. 
Page 5: §3ö§0: Like the U umlaut, combine the U sound with an English A. As in the word §6bay§0. While making this A sound, curve your lips, the sound produced should be a U umlaut.§0
§cPlease use Google for this part, it's very difficult to describe on-paper.
Page 6: §3ß§0: This is an Eszet. Make sure not to mistake it for a B, as it's pronounced nothing like it. The eszet is basically a short way to write a double s in German.§0
§0Example:§0
§6Füßen§0, a short way to write §6Füssen§0. §0
§0(§6Feet§0, in English.)
Page 7: A few other things to note about pronounciation of German letters:§0
§0===================§6W§0: Pronounced exactly like an English V.§0
§6V§0: Pronounced exactly like an English F.§0
§6J§0: Pronounced like an English Y. Example:§0
§0Ja = Yah.
Page 8: §6R§0: Google this one, too. It's pronounced very much like a French R, a gutteral sound from the back of your throat.§0
§6Z§0: Pronounced like an English TS. As in Pan§6ts§0. For example, Zehn (ten) is pronounced like Tsayn.
Page 9: Just like in English, groups of letters will make certain sounds together.§0
§6sch§0: Pronounced exactly like an English SH. Example: Tschüss!§0
§0would be pronounced like tshooss. (It's similar to saying Cheers! to a friend.)
Page 10: §6eu§0: Pronounced like an English -oy, as in the word b§6oy§0.§0
§6äu§0: Exactly like the EU, it is pronounced like -oy.§0
§6ie§0: Pronounced like an English ee, as in B§6ee§0.§0
§6ei§0: Pronounced like the English letter I, as in NEIN!
Page 11: §6-ch§0: The infamous flem, like you're coughing up a hairball. I'd recommend Googling this one, too.§0
§6-r§0: When an R comes at the end of a word, like a British accent, it is not pronounced. Example: Besser is pronounced like Bessah.
Page 12: §cth§0: This one is in red because it is NOT pronounced in German like in English. There is not a TH sound (like in the) in German. A TH together is simply pronounced like a T.
Page 13: Keep in mind that silent letters are almost nonexistant in German! Often you will find E's on the end of words, these are pronounced like (uh), like you're thinking about something. (uhhhh)§0

Page 4:      Introduction§0
§0=================== Welcome to potion brewing! If you're new, keep in mind that you need a brewing stand, glass bottles filled with water, and many ingredients, which vary depending on what type of potion you may want to create.
Page 5:      Introduction§0
§0=================== Every brewing stand has the capability to hold at maximum three bottles at a time, meaning you can make 3 potions for every single ingredient you add. Keep this in mind!
Page 6:   Base Ingredients§0
§0=================== These ingredients start all potions.§0
§0------------------- ?Nether Wart§0
§0?Glowstone Dust§0
§0?Redstone§0
§0?Fermented Spider Eye [Adding these to a water bottle will create a base potion. see page 11]
Page 7: Secondary Ingredients =================== ?Magma Creme§0
§0?Sugar§0
§0?Glistering Melon§0
§0?Spider Eye§0
§0?Ghast Tear§0
§0?Blaze Powder§0
§0?Fermented Spider Eye§0
§0?Golden Carrot§0
§0?Pufferfish§0
§0?Rabit's Foot
Page 8:         Modifiers§0
§0=================== Add these to a potion to alter their effects. -------------------?Redstone§0

§0?Glowstone Dust§0
§0[Increases potency]§0
§0?Gunpowder§0
§0[Turns into a splash]§0
§0?Fermented Spider Eye§0
§0[See next page]
Page 9:   Effect Corruption§0
§0=================== Fermented Spider Eyes will change a potion's base effect, often reversing it or producing a negative potion. A "corrupted" potion usually does the opposite of the original potion.
Page 10:       Base Potions§0
§0=================== Base potions, much like base ingredients, are the basis of all potions. These are the potions created by simply a watter bottle and a base ingredient together.

"I can´t believe it, I am a piplup... but how? why did this happen to me? I am a human"
the piplup said

"maybe you can find answers at the master´s guild, is up there"

---MISSING MOBS---

Book 1 of
THE C0LDCAKE FILES
A book of mystery
By RainCake


=O Missing Mobs! =O
Chickens..Horses..Cats..Dogs..
 M Y S T E R I E S !
Page 1: -----CHAPTER 1----
-Day 1-

In my house of magical magicallyness, there is many creatures. Horses, cats, dogs, chickens, and such.
Downstairs I had unnamed horses, upstairs chickens for my mini-farm, and inside I had a pet dog
Page 2: - named Gryphon. The next day I logged on, Gryphon was GONE. Therefore, Gryphon was claimed DEAD. This was a shock to the community -no not really..just me XD- I had to make a grave for the dear old dog.
Disappointed, I decided to get a cat...
Page 3: The next day I got a cat named "TNT," a ginger tabby. I made a special room for TNT so he didn't have to have the same fate as Gryphon. The room had a catbed, and colorful wool as the walls. It was rather small..I felt like an abusive pet owner XD anyways
Page 4: I had a door, and kept TNT sitting in his cat bed, where he NEVER got out of, never, I never even let him out. lol. And I kept the door shut, always. 
A few days of watching TNT later, I came back to an empty cat room. TNT WAS GONE D= And upstairs, the--
Page 5: mini chicken farm was empty too! No chickens left in sight. That was just surely, the next stage of this great massacre mystery!
My named horses were still safe-- thank goodness-- so I decided to look at my hidden-basement horses, unnamed-
Page 6: They were for sale, if you want one, you needed to contact me, and I would give you one -either for free for a very low price- There was about 20 horses, I went downstairs. There was only 4 left. I was bewildered-- what could have done this???
Page 7: Since I am a diplomat, I have a protected area, so its pretty safe. I also built a giant glass fence around my area. I made sure there was no vines or easy entrances inside. So I was very confused...how could have this had happened..several times?
Page 8: I learned ,that there is only a few ways it could have happened:
1. Someone used TP Arrow to go inside, and kill the animals.
2. Someone might have used "Butcher." 
3. Someone found an entrance and griefed/killed the creatures.
Page 9: I am still bewildered on the fact that every mob I get, most likely will die. I have finally got a mini farm of multiple mobs upstairs, only to live in fear that they will suffer the same fate as those who did before.
HOPEFULLY, we can find a way to stop
Page 10: griefing forever, maybe for starters, get rid of commands such as butcher or TP Arrow, I know some people love these commands, but you can easily use them to grief someone. 
~ THE END OF A WEIRD BOOK. =D

Once there was a wolf living in the sky.

the skyblock server was a peaceful place to stay, so the wulfy made a home
Page 2: it rendered as smooth as it could be and had not much

but what he had was enough to live a peaceful progressive life
Page 3: he thought he was all alone until he changed his settings to far and noticed he was not alone

far away there were little homes at equal distance each one from another

with people leaving the same way...
Page 4: as the wolfy was leaving 


as an eternal grid above the eternal void

	Author: XxChaosIncxX
	Type: Written

Page 0: §9Prologue:

§0Despite the downpour,
Chaos boldy ventured
on into the woeful
valley of
blackened elms.

The sopping sounds of
his splashing feet
echoed into the still,
rain-drenched woods.
Page 1: The burdens he bore
were great, not only
those on his
back, but those of the
heavy toll of sin on
his soul.

Everyone. Not a single
peasant spared. He
mused over his
decision to kill
everyone that looked
like the damned.
Page 2: "Perhaps my judgement
was too harsh. Yes,
that woman really
meant no harm."

He chuckled in
remembrance of the
mass slaughter in the
peaceful hamlet.
Chaos was a hearty
paladin-cow.
Page 3: He didn't stop to think
as he systematically
purged the entire
town.
Penance must be paid

He was on a spiritual
quest to cleanse his
sins he had done in
the company of the
alluring man mage,
Zhalfir.
Page 4: §6Chapter 1

§5-Seven weeks ago, the
hour of the
tendercrisp bacon elf
sandwich.
Page 5: Leaning on the
banister of the
dwarven trade ship,
Chaos saw the Mage's
mighty tower from at
least three fortnight's
walks.

The knight-errant
Chaos had recieved an
ultimatum from the
Dwarven Council.
Page 6: The council were the
rulers of the kingdom
Stoutschmeckle.

Chaos was a simple
man-cow; a mercenary
with a fancy title, and
was by far no means
a hero. He sported a
draping moustache, his
bedraggled hair the
typical burly brown of
his highland homeland.
Page 7: His armor was of
modest leather and
iron, and by chance an
unadorned steel cap
sat atop his head.

No true knight was he.

His equipment
consisted of a sturdy
black mace and a
round shield adorned
with a blue spiral.
Page 8: An ample sack covered
his cape, full of
whimsical odds and
ends necessary for
survival in the world in
which he resided.

The nights were long
and the days were hot,
but in time the sea
voyage met its end.
Page 9: Upon arrival, Chaos
strolled off of the
gangway and onto
solid ground.

The wind whipped up
from the grey ocean
as he beheld the
impressive edifice in
its full glory.
Page 10: Grim clouds slowly
whirled about the top
of the looming
structure, as if by
some...magical force,
perhaps.

He trundled toward
the base of the tower,
and shambled up the
incline to the
entrance.
Page 11: Chaos paused upon
the last step on the
top of the cascading
stairway that led to a
somber, shale door
set in the base of the
stupendous monolith.

A feeling of doubt
washed over him,
quickly being shook
away, knowing he must
press on.
Page 12: He forged his iron will
anew into steel and
reached for the goblin
shaped knocker on the
left of a similar, troll
headed one. 

He recoiled in horror
when the statue's
eyes rolled about
madly.
Page 13: 
"Wahts we got here
Elliott?" the sentient
copper goblin giggled.

"I thinks its fresh
meat for the master."
squealed Elliott the
troll head.
Page 14: Shat-tap, bitch. You
sound like a shrieking
milkmaid who's just
seen a barewolf!
Page 15: "Oh, certainly," replied
the goblin. "But we are
only here to forewarn
the supple fools who
Master lures in.
Secure your ass
plate, noble knight! For
Master desires
manflesh more than
anything these days.

But business is
business, so says I.
Page 16: So enter, but 
remember us well.

For we are the only
pair of knockers you'll
ever see in this tower!
Hee Hee!"

The two copper beings
parted to the sides as
the gates swung
open.
Page 17: Chaos set forth in
determination. He
passed through the
foreboding entrance
and came upon a
crossroads.

Three halls diverged,
marked by troubling,
leering gargoyles. The
left probed deep into
the innermost clutches
of the burly ground.
Page 18: The one ahead
consisted of a
seemingly endless
hallway. The rightmost
path led up a
mesmerizing staircase.

Chaos' keen snout
sensed a moist wind
emanating from the
spiral staircase.
Page 19: Knowing that the
master wizard. Zhalfir
could only exist in a
solid state in sopping
climes, he turned and
began to ascend the
staircase.
Page 20: "Ware the seductions
of Master," the goblin
echoed from behind.
"Even the straightest
arrow can be bent!"

After the warning,
Elliott let loose a
squeal that sounded a
little bit like a fire
hose sprayed through
an electric fan filled
with pelicans and -
Page 21: whistling track
coaches who had a
little too much time on
their hands and liked
to play tug of war
behind the snack
shack but one day the
tennis kids came by
and tipped it over,
subsequently trapping
them in the tomblike
waste wallow and he
hated his life
Page 22: and all the days after
no one looked at him
quite the same way, not
even his family and
that's what Elliott's
scream sounded like.

Chaos ventured
deeper into the
labyrinthine halls. As
he progressed, he
began to fall into
a dreamlike state.
Page 23: The winding corridors
seemed to shift as
inexplicable enigmas
danced within his
primitive manbrain.

His rhythmic footsteps
were punctuated by
mysterious sounds;
sudden soft laughter,
or the quiet shutting
of a door.
Page 24: He felt a singular
sense of disquiet as
he strode ever
quicker down the
corridor, fighting the
trancelike waves of
unreality.

He was suddenly
aware of a vast
presence behind him,
and he whirled
around.
Page 25: Shield set and mace
drawn back, but
nothing was there, and
Chaos began to doubt
his own sanity.

§7(Certainly it wasn't
there in the first
place because he kills
a shit load of innocent
people.)
Page 26: Then a notion arose.
Perhaps Chaos was
not really wandering
the halls, not even
moving. Gods! 

He was wandering
within his own mind! He
must get back to
consciousness right
now, lest he wake up
with a sore ass.
Page 27: He struggled through
the blurring mire of
the dreamworld, trying
to reach out for
consciousness.

Finally, with all of his
will, he snapped back
awake, and found
himself in a dim, velvet
room.
Page 28: His armor covered in
rose petals, but
thankfully still on.

Page 3: Prologue
[3 Minutes Before]
 Twas 3 minutes before it all came down. I was sitting on the couch sweat beaten wearing nothing when I heard it coming. It opened the door, and turned out to be Puar. It came with a thrust all over my bust. 
Page 4: [Present]
I saw the Meteor flying down, ready for impact, and knew I had to stop it. I planned slowly and carefully, aligning my mouth perfectly to it. There was sweat on my chin when the red throbbing meteors head landed in my mouth. I knew this would be
Page 5: too much for one person to handle, as it was nearly 4 inches from the ground. The Meteor picked a target of it's taste, a busty tan girl with brown hair, that goes by the name of nrokin. It thrusted back and forth, and I had to act quickly if I wanted to 
Page 6: take down this meteor. I quickly pulled out my tracfone while battling this beast and texted my best friend Vic. You could describe her as very pale, but not as busty, with beautiful hair. She hurried over as fast as she could to help take down this
Page 7: meteor before we could put more people at risk. Victoria and I battled for the head of the meteor, trying our best to take turns, although the meteor kept beating us with it's stick, trying to tell us that it only has a couple of minutes left. That only
Page 8: meant we had to work harder and harder to take it down, and that's when it happened, the meteor exploded into a giant white shower of amazingness all over our faces, and we licked off eachothers faces, spitting it into eachother's mouths. We then finished
Page 9: it off by swallowing. They then spend the next hour or so entertaining themselves in ways TehSabbingSlayer would have enjoyed. They know it won't be the last meteor, so they will always be ready to take down another together, otherwise the whole
Page 10: world is at risk. The tale ends with two bare women feeling accomplishment in their life, very happy with the award they earned. Who knows how many meteors they will have to take on during the weekend...

§04: The best enchants
Page 1: If you've experienced survival Minecraft before, you should know what enchanting is. If not, enchanting is a "game of luck" in order to gain buffs on weapons, tools, and armor. In order to enchant, you must acquire an enchantment table and bookshelves.
Page 2: To fully experience the glory of enchanting, you need a total of 1 enchantment table, 20 bookshelves and however many lapis lazuli. To enchant, right-click the enchantment table to open a window. Place in your item, add lapis, pick an enchant, and viola!
Page 3: The luckiest of enchants would most likely be Fortune, this allows you to get more items from what you mined/broke. Another lucky enchant is silk touch, which allows you to pick up spawners and glass without breaking them. Lucky enchants for weapons would
Page 4: be looting, allowing you to get more drops from each mob you kill. Good armor enchants are protection and aqua infinity.
Page 5: More will be coming from the tutorial handbooks of Neskah and tatertot07637. Look on the market to find our latest books!

Page 4:      Introduction§0
§0=================== Welcome to potion brewing! If you're new, keep in mind that you need a brewing stand, glass bottles filled with water, and many ingredients, which vary depending on what type of potion you may want to create.
Page 5:      Introduction§0
§0=================== Every brewing stand has the capability to hold at maximum three bottles at a time, meaning you can make 3 potions for every single ingredient you add. Keep this in mind!
Page 6:   Base Ingredients§0
§0=================== These ingredients start all potions.§0
§0------------------- ?Nether Wart§0
§0?Glowstone Dust§0
§0?Redstone§0
§0?Fermented Spider Eye [Adding these to a water bottle will create a base potion. see page 11]
Page 7: Secondary Ingredients =================== ?Magma Creme§0
§0?Sugar§0
§0?Glistering Melon§0
§0?Spider Eye§0
§0?Ghast Tear§0

§0?Fermented Spider Eye§0
§0[See next page]
Page 9:   Effect Corruption§0
§0=================== Fermented Spider Eyes will change a potion's base effect, often reversing it or producing a negative potion. A "corrupted" potion usually does the opposite of the original potion.
Page 10:       Base Potions§0
§0=================== Base potions, much like base ingredients, are the basis of all potions. These are the potions created by simply a watter bottle and a base ingredient together.

Page 1: Hah-Not sure if you meant this for me or not so I'm replying hoping you'll tell me who this is for :p §0
§0-pix <3§0
§0Oh that was silly of me. There's only two people added to this chest so of course this is for me, right? :p thanks Bio :D
Page 2: Haha, yep, it's meant for you.  Panda was somebody I hadn't seen online here in like 6-12 months, maybe more. They had changed how the signs on chests worked at some point and I had to redo all of the locked chests, and just left them off. Not that they 
Page 3: had anything of value. Anyway, I bought all your diamonds on the auction house. They sell for more, but figured you wanted the mums :) I have about 30k in mums right now. Gotta run. - Bio
Page 4: Ahahaha nice :P i got 30k too thanks to you haha. Seriously, we never catch each other online lol XD§0
§0Well keep trying :p§0
§0-pix
Page 5: I have a friend in town who I haven't seen in two years. He's in the army, so he's overseas a lot. Been drinking and playing PS4 games. lol§0
§0-Bio
Page 6: lol :p But we are always within like an hour of each other!!! It's crazy. We're just not meant to see each other :( haahha And that's cool that you're friends there XD
Page 7: LOL, when were you on? I think I was on at like 2am (central time) when I wrote my last message, and I'm on again now at 8:50am.§0
§0
§0Hoping for a slow day today, don't want to have to do any real work. - Bio
Page 8: Haha cool. I don't know what you mean by central time tho... :/ When you get on do /seen pixel8ed_girl it will tell you when I was last on in case you didn't know that :p§0
§0
§0The other day it was lapiz, today it is iron. Yes, Bio, I have robbed you again. I 
Page 9: am very sorry and hope to get some back to you soon. :p Thanks§0
§0-pix
Page 10: heh, no worries so long as you aren't robbing me blind =P  If I have tons of stuff, I likely don't care. If it's really rare, then I may care a little. Mainly just my tools and armor are what I care about.§0
§0
§0Central time is a time zone.. so states like MN,
Page 11: WI, IA, IL, MO, etc. I'm only assuming you're from the USA. §0
§0
§0Long weekend, time to recover and be healthy again =P How was your weekend?§0
§0-Bio
Page 12: Hahah okie thanks. :p Long weekend as well T-T and with school starting soon I will have even less time to play :(( But-I applied for ambie today. I think I have a semi-good chance considering spart is a mod now XD
Page 13: What does an ambassador do on here?  I never pay attention to that stuff. I also forget that right now your whole life is like a big weekend =P I'd be spending more time at the pool if I didn't have any real obligations during the week. heh -Bio
Page 14: Hahaha true. Ambassador monitors chats and sometimes helps with modreqs. Also they have all diplo perks and a few more.
Page 15: Ahh, nice, so you'd get to travel all over for free and have multiple points you can easily warp to? Tonight is National Night out day or something, where our neighborhood is supposed to all get together to socialize. Going to have to bake a dessert today
Page 16: for the event tonight. Oh, booked a trip for the Virgin Islands in November last night =P -Bio
Page 17: Hahahaha cool. You have so much life stuff happening. I just have school -_- But thankfully school's not too bad for me, I've got an amazing class.
Page 18: What class is amazing? Being an adult has its advantages, but I occasionally miss being a kid. I run my own businesses out of my home, so I have a lot of responsibilities. A lot more than the average person with a regular job. I have to worry about 
Page 19: inventory levels, making sure orders get out the same day, handling customer issues, making sure vendors and contractors get paid, etc. I also have to manage our websites, ensure they're PCI compliant, and a lot more. - Bio
Page 20: hahahah nice. I meant that the people in my class are amazing XD Also, I'm taking a bit more lapiz this time but ill pay you ;p§0
§0-pix
Page 21: Ahh gotcha on the people in your class. lol You start again soon don't you? No worries on the lapis. I may be home alone this weekend, so if I am, I'll probably be on a lot.§0
§0-Bio§0
§0hah just saw you on, then log off right when i saw you were on. 12am CST
Page 22: ahahah That was probaly my brother. He plays on my account sometimes but I he gets off if my friends come on. :p School has already started for me and its so busy .-. Did I tell you, Im rich now xD I ave over 200k atm
Page 23: Wow!  How'd you get over 200k so quickly? Sorry to hear you're back in school already. School doesn't start until Sept here in MN. At least you like your class mates :) We did get griefed, but your brother fixed it. :p
Page 24: ahhh...I get me mums from l2d ;p my fav and easy to get mums. make around 20k in 10 mins or so... ;p but its hard to get used to 
Page 25: What is l2d? Long weekend for me, drove 7 hours to Chicago Friday night. Went to the Field Musuem of Natural History Saturday, so a lot of walking. Then went to Comic Con Sunday, a lot of walking and standing in lines. Drove him Monday.
Page 26: L2d=Left To Die. Its one of the servers on mutts you should play. Kinda boring and hard to get used to but it really brings in mums xD§0

Page 1: Hmmm...L2D had an update. The whole thing is different :( You can't earn nearly as much money anymore
Page 2: Aww, that's a bummer.  I never was able to get the hang of it. Half the time I got dropped into the middle of like 20 zombies and would die almost instantly, and the other half of the time I managed to kill maybe 10-15 of them. Couldn't dig through rock 
Page 3: though, so wasn't able to try and do anything creative or to get stuff to survive with.  Without rock I can't build a furnace to cook food in, and they only give you enough food to last though about 20 zombies.

Page 0: Dear Reader,

This home is properly owned by [kirbyi123] & [WhiteWolfLover]. We would appreciate if you didn't grief the farm, place blocks around the premisis, steal from chests, destroy stuff, and kill the animals. Think about it.
Page 1: If you owned this place, would you like it if I terrorized this lot? No, probably not.
We worked days on this place, it would be disrespectful if you gave away all that time we put in it succeed at our home. Build your own fricking home and get your own 
Page 2: rescorces. Griefing is rude, period. If you have a problem with that, go on your own game and build your own stuff, this place isn't a free destination to loot for your needs. If you respect that, thank you. You can look around all you desire, but...
Page 3: NO GRIEFING & LOOTING!

Have a good day!

Page 0: John stared out of the window over the houses, each one with a few people, all going about their lives normally, a cool breeze touched his face and he wondered why he couldn't be like them, of course he was sure others had felt this way, it was unlikely

Page 1: that he was the first, yet he still thought it and wondered how they managed to, to go to parties and generally be socially functioning, normal people, John didn't have many friends, and he had never spoken with anyone about anything of truly great import
Page 2: about himself, the house felt more like a prison than a place to live, he couldn't stand it, the energy coursing though his veins, he wanted to go outside and scream at the world until he found someone who was the same, but he never would, he could never 
Page 3: just abandon the pretense of sanity, yet he continued to feel like an outsider. If John ever spoke to people about the regular trivial things that people so often talk about, it was usually because he was thrust into the situation against his will.
Page 4: His thoughts raced, neurons firing carrying precious data working on one thousand and one problems that he would probably never work out the solution to before he was hit by it again, the overwhelming sense that it was pointless and that he should just
Page 5: give up.

He would have sighed, but he didn't make sounds when he was alone, it never seemed right to him, he closed the window and took a spinning jump onto his bed, sprawling himself on the sheets that just seemed rough and uncomfortable,
Page 6: waiting silently for the maelstrom of his thoughts to calm so he could finally fall asleep.

[3 Minutes Before]
 Twas 3 minutes before it all came down. I was sitting on the couch sweat beaten wearing nothing when I heard it coming. It opened the door, and turned out to be Puar. It came with a thrust all over my bust. 
Page 4: [Present]
I saw the Meteor flying down, ready for impact, and knew I had to stop it. I planned slowly and carefully, aligning my mouth perfectly to it. There was sweat on my chin when the red throbbing meteors head landed in my mouth. I knew this would be
Page 5: too much for one person to handle, as it was nearly 4 inches from the ground. The Meteor picked a target of it's taste, a busty tan girl with brown hair, that goes by the name of nrokin. It thrusted back and forth, and I had to act quickly if I wanted to 
Page 6: take down this meteor. I quickly pulled out my tracfone while battling this beast and texted my best friend Vic. You could describe her as very pale, but not as busty, with beautiful hair. She hurried over as fast as she could to help take down this
Page 7: meteor before we could put more people at risk. Victoria and I battled for the head of the meteor, trying our best to take turns, although the meteor kept beating us with it's stick, trying to tell us that it only has a couple of minutes left. That only
Page 8: meant we had to work harder and harder to take it down, and that's when it happened, the meteor exploded into a giant white shower of amazingness all over our faces, and we licked off eachothers faces, spitting it into eachother's mouths. We then finished
Page 9: it off by swallowing. They then spend the next hour or so entertaining themselves in ways TehSabbingSlayer would have enjoyed. They know it won't be the last meteor, so they will always be ready to take down another together, otherwise the whole
Page 10: world is at risk. The tale ends with two bare women feeling accomplishment in their life, very happy with the award they earned. Who knows how many meteors they will have to take on during the weekend...

Still a better love story than twilight - Everyone

5/5 Would Finger to again - 80% of lesbians

Muttsworld Lesbian Erotica 2013 Award
Page 2: Audrey was a tall, long-haired brunette with brown eyes and the face of a goddess. She was everyone's dream. Unfortunately for the male population this woman was blessed with the curse of being a lesbian. Countless men and women were dumbstruck by her
Page 3: looks. The dominate, aggressive, Audrey had no preference for men. She enjoyed taking submissive women and turning them into her playtoys for the evening.

Audrey went to a coffee shop to get coffee. What the hell else would she get at
Page 4: a coffee shop? Condoms? NO. However, there was this cute girl named Sofia. She had a soft-round cute face. One you could fuck all night to.

Now that we have the two main characters in the scene. Let's get to the hot and sexy part. The shower....
Page 5: LLOOL JK WHO HAS SEX IN A SHOWER.

So, the two warmed things up nice and sweet with a shower. Some cute cuddling standing up and fondling tits and washing each other. As they are about to get dirty so I don't know why they didn't save
Page 6: the shower until after. Audrey gets tired after sex don't judge her.

Sofia lays down naked on the bed and Audrey is not slow to lay ontop of Sofia's wet naked body. Sofia and Audrey were both athletes so they had nice hot bodies.
Page 7: Hot too look at, not hot to touch atleast not until they started to fuck.

Things got hot.

The bed sheets melted.

The house caught on fire.

No bodies could be
Page 8: found in the charred remains of their hot, steamy, sexy, sex.

LOL JK that would be horrible. SO let's focus back onto the bed.

Now, I'm sure we all know what happens when to lovely lesbians get together
Page 9: in a bed. So, i'll spare you the details.

I'm sure your head can do the rest of the work. Add some strapons or only use one. Or two. Ten. Kinky shit man. Not litterally. 

The End.

Page 0: John woke up, he always woke up before any sound was there to wake him, but no-one would ever actually know that, he waiting on his bed with his eyes closed, going back over his thoughts from the night before, feeling the torrent begin again,
Page 1: the masses of information swirled around his head, it was like loud rock music being blasted directly into his brain and it almost always ended with him getting a headache. After what felt like a few minutes had passed, he heard the sound of his mother
Page 2: calling him from downstairs, there was some logic missing in this, he had long ago decided, as he always, without fail, got up fifteen minutes before he was meant to be at school, which was the exact amount of time it took for him to throw on his uniform,
Page 3: eat breakfast, and take the short journey to school. John's mother however, had never seemed to grasp this fact, and insisted on calling him down approximately forty-five minutes before he had to be there, despite him remaining in his state
Page 4: of psudo-sleep for another half and hour, he did not fail to meet this tradition on that particular morning. After the usual argument about this morning ritual had taken place, and no ground had been made by either individual, he lifelessly chewed on his 
Page 5: toast and made his way to school, he arrived slinging his bag onto the floor and waiting for the morning period to start, some people he considered his friends chatted amiably in the background about nothing in particular and he continued to sit there,
Page 6: not paying any heed, the teacher arrived and he stood up, his teachers name was Dr Smith and she was one of the few teachers in the school who seemed to have an ounce of logic, and therefore he respected her greatly, logic being something that was in 
Page 7: short supply in the world in general, still feeling that same sense of disconnecteddness he shuffled into the room and took his seat, he took out a pad of paper and absently began to write, not paying any particular attention to what he wrote, he looked
Page 8: down and proclaimed it to be garbage and scrunched it up and shoved it in a pocket for either some further use later or to be thrown away, he played with his pen, only pausing in his thoughts to respond to his name being called, he was struck by a sudden 
Page 9: and totally irrational sadness, his mind helpfully threw up some images of the worst events he could think about and his hands started to shake, he stilled them with a concious mental effort and began trying to focus on what the teacher was saying, the
Page 10: words slipping out of his mind, he suffered from working and short term memory issues, that was what the report said anyway, his attention rapidly diminished and he went back to his pen, which he looked at sadly and put away, his friend said something
Page 11: to him which he responded to without thinking, he was suddenly and without any kind of warning very irritated by this and wanted to be alone. It was horrible, the way he viewed the world constantly shifting and changing, with no reason or method.
Page 12: He wanted to scream and run out of the classroom, and finally break down and let his emotions run, but he never would, he had to keep up the appearence of sanity, or what was left of it, people did notice his strangeness, he was an oddity and could never
Page 13: seem to say the right thing, he glared enviously at the people to whom the right things to say seemed to come so easily, he attempted to smile and only managed to make his face scrunch into something horrible, people gave him odd looks and he tried to
Page 14: cover it with a signature manic smile, he would rather let it be known that he was odd that let people know he just couldn't do it, his face wouldn't do what he wanted it to, and it always ended up looking stupid, inappropriate, or both.


Page 15: The bell rang, waking John from his idle musings, he grabbed his bag and made his way to the biology classroom. The rest of the day was filled with idle conversation with the few people who wanted to talk to him, or at least were willing to, and the
Page 16: scratching of his pen on paper, writing words, but never the ones that he wanted to write, words without meaning.

The clock lazily swung its hands towards the ending of the day, and he swung his backpack onto his back. When he got home he went on
Page 17: his computer, looking at several things that did make him laugh internally, he was not humourless, as some people thought, it was just that he was never really able to express his joy, or at least that was what he told himself. His mother greeted him when
Page 18: he got home and he dutifully filled out the expected role and said his day was fine with a forced smile, people irritated him, it wasn't their fault, they just did what they were expected to do, they filled their roles, because they had never been taught 
Page 19: that they were allowed to become more than what was expected, to think outside the box and actually act on those obscure concepts such as 'making the world a better place'. John could never do that, not since he had realised that he didn't have to, but it
Page 20: still got to him, not that people rejected him for it, it would take more than that to break his will, but more the shrugs of indifference that they expressed, like they had seen it before, he was just another kid who thought rebellion was as simple as
Page 21: declaring yourself different and wearing black, but he never intended to do that, he wanted to go out and face the darkness of the world, force it to confront him, but the world would not listen.

Besides, he knew it wasn't that simple, people could not
Page 22: just go out and face the dark like batman and superman, that would not change anything, he might, if he became a policeman stop a hundred or a thousand crimes, but that would not change anything, what was needed was something that would change the world,
Page 23: permanently for the better, to finally make people realised that it was something different to declare that people should respect others regardless of who they were, and to actually act upon it, the difference between carrying out the role of someone
Page 24: who wanted things to change, and the person who actually sits there and tries to work out how to make the world a better place for everyone, once and for all...

	Title: Cow's Tale: Ch1
	Author: XxChaosIncxX
	Type: Written

Page 0: §9Prologue:

§0Despite the downpour,
Chaos boldy ventured
on into the woeful
valley of
blackened elms.

The sopping sounds of
his splashing feet
echoed into the still,
rain-drenched woods.
Page 1: The burdens he bore
were great, not only
those on his
back, but those of the
heavy toll of sin on
his soul.

Everyone. Not a single
peasant spared. He
mused over his
decision to kill
everyone that looked
like the damned.
Page 2: "Perhaps my judgement
was too harsh. Yes,
that woman really
meant no harm."

He chuckled in
remembrance of the
mass slaughter in the
peaceful hamlet.
Chaos was a hearty
paladin-cow.
Page 3: He didn't stop to think
as he systematically
purged the entire
town.
Penance must be paid

He was on a spiritual
quest to cleanse his
sins he had done in
the company of the
alluring man mage,
Zhalfir.
Page 4: §6Chapter 1

§5-Seven weeks ago, the
hour of the
tendercrisp bacon elf
sandwich.
Page 5: Leaning on the
banister of the
dwarven trade ship,
Chaos saw the Mage's
mighty tower from at
least three fortnight's
walks.

The knight-errant
Chaos had recieved an
ultimatum from the
Dwarven Council.
Page 6: The council were the
rulers of the kingdom
Stoutschmeckle.

Chaos was a simple
man-cow; a mercenary
with a fancy title, and
was by far no means
a hero. He sported a
draping moustache, his
bedraggled hair the
typical burly brown of
his highland homeland.
Page 7: His armor was of
modest leather and
iron, and by chance an
unadorned steel cap
sat atop his head.

No true knight was he.

His equipment
consisted of a sturdy
black mace and a
round shield adorned
with a blue spiral.
Page 8: An ample sack covered
his cape, full of
whimsical odds and
ends necessary for
survival in the world in
which he resided.

The nights were long
and the days were hot,
but in time the sea
voyage met its end.
Page 9: Upon arrival, Chaos
strolled off of the
gangway and onto
solid ground.

The wind whipped up
from the grey ocean
as he beheld the
impressive edifice in
its full glory.
Page 10: Grim clouds slowly
whirled about the top
of the looming
structure, as if by
some...magical force,
perhaps.

He trundled toward
the base of the tower,
and shambled up the
incline to the
entrance.
Page 11: Chaos paused upon
the last step on the
top of the cascading
stairway that led to a
somber, shale door
set in the base of the
stupendous monolith.

A feeling of doubt
washed over him,
quickly being shook
away, knowing he must
press on.
Page 12: He forged his iron will
anew into steel and
reached for the goblin
shaped knocker on the
left of a similar, troll
headed one. 

He recoiled in horror
when the statue's
eyes rolled about
madly.
Page 13: 
"Wahts we got here
Elliott?" the sentient
copper goblin giggled.

"I thinks its fresh
meat for the master."
squealed Elliott the
troll head.
Page 14: Shat-tap, bitch. You
sound like a shrieking
milkmaid who's just
seen a barewolf!
Page 15: "Oh, certainly," replied
the goblin. "But we are
only here to forewarn
the supple fools who
Master lures in.
Secure your ass
plate, noble knight! For
Master desires
manflesh more than
anything these days.

But business is
business, so says I.
Page 16: So enter, but 
remember us well.

For we are the only
pair of knockers you'll
ever see in this tower!
Hee Hee!"

The two copper beings
parted to the sides as
the gates swung
open.
Page 17: Chaos set forth in
determination. He
passed through the
foreboding entrance
and came upon a
crossroads.

Three halls diverged,
marked by troubling,
leering gargoyles. The
left probed deep into
the innermost clutches
of the burly ground.
Page 18: The one ahead
consisted of a
seemingly endless
hallway. The rightmost
path led up a
mesmerizing staircase.

Chaos' keen snout
sensed a moist wind
emanating from the
spiral staircase.
Page 19: Knowing that the
master wizard. Zhalfir
could only exist in a
solid state in sopping
climes, he turned and
began to ascend the
staircase.
Page 20: "Ware the seductions
of Master," the goblin
echoed from behind.
"Even the straightest
arrow can be bent!"

After the warning,
Elliott let loose a
squeal that sounded a
little bit like a fire
hose sprayed through
an electric fan filled
with pelicans and -
Page 21: whistling track
coaches who had a
little too much time on
their hands and liked
to play tug of war
behind the snack
shack but one day the
tennis kids came by
and tipped it over,
subsequently trapping
them in the tomblike
waste wallow and he
hated his life
Page 22: and all the days after
no one looked at him
quite the same way, not
even his family and
that's what Elliott's
scream sounded like.

Chaos ventured
deeper into the
labyrinthine halls. As
he progressed, he
began to fall into
a dreamlike state.
Page 23: The winding corridors
seemed to shift as
inexplicable enigmas
danced within his
primitive manbrain.

His rhythmic footsteps
were punctuated by
mysterious sounds;
sudden soft laughter,
or the quiet shutting
of a door.
Page 24: He felt a singular
sense of disquiet as
he strode ever
quicker down the
corridor, fighting the
trancelike waves of
unreality.

He was suddenly
aware of a vast
presence behind him,
and he whirled
around.
Page 25: Shield set and mace
drawn back, but
nothing was there, and
Chaos began to doubt
his own sanity.

§7(Certainly it wasn't
there in the first
place because he kills
a shit load of innocent
people.)
Page 26: Then a notion arose.
Perhaps Chaos was
not really wandering
the halls, not even
moving. Gods! 

He was wandering
within his own mind! He
must get back to
consciousness right
now, lest he wake up
with a sore ass.
Page 27: He struggled through
the blurring mire of
the dreamworld, trying
to reach out for
consciousness.

Finally, with all of his
will, he snapped back
awake, and found
himself in a dim, velvet
room.
Page 28: His armor covered in
rose petals, but
thankfully still on.

	Title: Chocca I Part 2
	Author: choccabloc
	Type: Written

Page 0:      Choccabloc I§0
§0       Part Two§0
§0
§0It had been three years since Choccabloc became chief when her next adventure began...§0
§0   She was minding her own business, just farming some wheat and melons on a sunny day in her village.
Page 1: "Hey Chief... I don't want to worry you..." a villager said, holding a block of netherrack in its hand, "but we found something you might want to see..."§0
§0  Robin the Villager quickly led her to a field behind the stables for her to find quite a 
Page 2: mysterious object... It was four blocks high and six blocks up, it had a rim of purpley-black blocks, one block in with and a spine tingling purple mist in the middle. The whole thing was a perfect rectangle...§0
§0   "It's a portal. chief... it leads you to 
Page 3: a strange place with mutant zombies and lava pools, "Robin said as Choccabloc inspected the portal, "Percy went through it to see what it was like... he hasn't returned..."§0
§0   Choccabloc knew exactly wahat she needed to do.. but it was not going to be 
Page 4: easy...§0
§0   The next day she prepared for her mission. She rushed to her chest, put all the valuable this in her inventory into her chest, took off her diamond armourand put them into her chest, there was no way she could risk losing her 
Page 5: best armour.§0
§0   So she set off with only an iron sword, chainmail armour and a diamond pick. She was ready.§0
§0    She ran towards the portal, her sword shaking in her hand, and was teleported to hell itself.§0
§0   All she could see was red. Red sky, Red
Page 6: sea, red ground. She looked up from the ground to see deformed pigmen and her heart started racing, her palms sweating. She picked up the courage to fight them. She ran towards one getting faster and faster as she dodged the pools of meltingly hot lava
Page 7: on the ground. To her surprise the Zombie stood still, he didn't even blink an eye... §0
§0   There was no point in destroying it, so she quickly ran around, looking for Percy the villager.§0
§0     After what felt like hours sprinting around that hell hole she 
Page 8: finally saw say him - his clothes were burnt ro a crisp and she had patches of burnt skin all over him, but worst of all - he was hanging from a cliff over the biggest pool of lava she had ever seen.§0
§0  She ran towards him, sweat dripping from her forehead
Page 9: determined to save him.§0
§0     "Help! Help! Please! Anyone?!" Percy screamed in dispear, you could hear him welling up with tears as she shouted.
  She sped up her running. faster, faster, even drinking speed potions to be quicker, but it was no use...
Page 10: She heard an ear piercing screech, but not from Percy...
 She turned around trying to locate the sound of the painful screeching.
   There it was, the most terrifying creature she had ever seen... a huge, snow white Ghast.

Page 11: Before she could even think about it she charged at it with her iron sword. 
   It shot blazing hot fireballs left right and centre, but it was no use, for Choccabloc had already gotten to it, and with one swift slice of her sword, it was gone. The sound 
Page 12: of hell was more peaceful again.
    it didn't take long for Choccabloc to snap to her senses and remember about Percy.
   She sprinted as fast as she could towards the screaming villager, his hands probably aching so much
Page 13: they could fall off.
   She grabbed one of his hands and yanked him to his feet. 
"Thank you Chocca! Thank you so much!" He exclamed wrapping his burnt arms around her.
  They made their way back to the portal with hardly any interruptions
Page 14: or attcking mobs... all was peaceful...for a while, anyway. 
  They travelled back through the portal and that was the end of their adventure.
        
       ~The End~

Yesterday 4/6/2015 a mysterious occurance happened. There was serveral reports of flying pigs! These pigs were killed off and none were left to be studied with science.
Some skeptics say 
Page 4: they were riding bats, but they have been stoned for herracy.

In recent news the survival server was down longer than 10 minutes! This tragic event happened early this evening. Everything seems to be in good shape now as no one was hurt in the

Page 1:  Toward the end of the 1940s, Soviet researchers sealed five prison inmates in an airtight chamber and dosed them with an experimental stimulant gas to test the effects of prolonged sleep deprivation. 
Page 2: Their behavior was observed via two-way mirrors and their conversations monitored electronically. They had been promised their freedom if they could go entirely without sleep for 30 days.
Page 3: The first few days of the experiment passed uneventfully. By the fifth day, however, the subjects began showing signs of stress and were overheard bemoaning their circumstances. 
Page 4: hey stopped conversing with their fellow inmates, choosing instead to whisper compromising information about one another into the microphones, apparently in an effort to win the favor of the researchers. 
Page 5: Paranoia set §0in.On§0 the ninth day the screaming began. First one subject, then another, was observed running around the chamber screaming at the top of his lungs for hours on end. 
Page 6: Equally disconcerting was the reaction of the quieter subjects, who began ripping apart the books they'd been given to read, smearing the pages with feces, and plastering them over the mirrored windows so their actions could no longer be observed.
Page 7: Just as suddenly, the screaming stopped. The subjects ceased communicating altogether. Three long days passed without a sound from inside the §0chamber.Fearing§0 the worst, the researchers addressed the subjects via the intercom.
Page 8: We are opening the chamber to test the microphones," they said. "Step away from the door and lie flat on the floor or you will be shot. Compliance will earn one of you your immediate freedom."A voice from inside answered, We no longer want to be freed."
Page 9: Two more days passed without contact of any kind as the scientists debated what to do next. Finally, they decided to terminate the experiment.
Page 10: At midnight on the fifteenth day the stimulant gas was flushed from the chamber and replaced with fresh air in preparation for the subjects' release.
Page 11: Far from being pleased at the prospect of leaving the chamber, the subjects began screaming as if in fear for their §0lives.They§0 begged to have the gas turned back on. Instead,the researchers unsealed the door to the
Page 12: chamber and sent armed soldiers inside to retrieve them. Nothing could have prepared them for the carnage they witnessed upon entering. One subject was found dead, lying face-down in sixinches of bloody water. Chunks of his
Page 13: flesh had been torn off and stuffed into the floor drain. All of the test subjects were found to have been severely mutilated, in fact. What's worse, the wounds appeared to be self-inflicted.
Page 14: They had ripped open their own abdomens and disemboweled themselves with their bare hands. Some had even eaten their own flesh. The four who were still alive seemed terrified of falling asleep and refused to leave the chamber, again pleading
Page 15: with the researchers to turn the gas back on. When the soldiers attempted to remove the inmates by force, they fought back so ferociously they couldn't believe their eyes. One suffered a ruptured spleen and lost so much blood 
Page 16: there was literally nothing left for his heart to pump, yet continued flailing for a full three minutes until his lifeless body collapsed. The remaining subjects were restrained and transported to a medical facility for treatment. 
Page 17: The first to be operated on fought so furiously against being anesthetized that he tore muscles and broke bones during the struggle. As soon as the anesthetic took effect his heart stopped and he died. The rest underwent surgery without sedation.
Page 18: Far from feeling any pain, however, they laughed hysterically on the operating table -- so hysterically that the doctors, perhaps fearing for their own sanity, administered a paralytic agent to immobilize them. After surgery the survivors were asked why 
Page 19: they had mutilated themselves, and why they so desperately wanted to go back on the stimulant gas. Each, in turn, gave the same answer: "I must remain awake."The researchers considered euthanizing them to obliterate every trace of the failed 
Page 20: experiment, but were overruled by their commanding officer, who ordered that it be resumed immediately, with three of the researchers joining the inmates in the sealed chamber. Horrified at the prospect, 
Page 21: the chief researcher pulled out a pistol and shot the commanding officer point blank. He then turned and shot one of the two surviving subjects. Pointing his gun at the last one left alive, he asked, What are you? I must know!"
Page 22: "Have you forgotten so easily?" the subject said, smiling. We are you. We are the madness that lurks within you all, begging to be free at every moment in your deepest animal mind. We are what you hide from in your beds every night.
Page 23: We are what you sedate into silence and paralysis when you go to the nocturnal haven where we cannot tread."
Page 24: The researcher fired a bullet into his heart. The EEG monitor flatlined as the subject murmured these last words: "§0So...nearly...free."§0

Page 0: Tree Sheep:
   These strage sheep are found in packs and sit in trees. They hardly ever leave the trees because they don't want to fall and loose health. [Most likely found in Oak and Birch trees.]
-------------------Derpy Bat:
   Derpy Bats are 
Page 1: found in caves everywhere. The difference from regular bats and the Derpy Bat is that the Derpy Bat is found flying into a wall with its face in a corner. I have rarely found it, but it is still a strange sight.

Page 2: Friendly Neighborhood Creeper:
   Most people who have played Minecraft since the dawn of time (2009) have come across the Friendly Neighborhood Creeper. It is also rarely found, mostly becuase creepers are meant to explode stuff, kill players, etc. This 
Page 3: kind of creeper, however, will not explode, and will not kill players. So no need for caution.

   So majestic, isn't it? Sitting there on the edge of a cliff- OH MAH GAWD PIGGY DON'T WORRY I'LL 
Page 4: SAVE YOU!- is the usual reaction to a mountain pig, sheep, or cow. I don't know why evil mobs don't stand on cliffs. Maybe because they aren't as majestic... [Found on mountain tops.]

Page 0: Hello, i didnt came here to play as a normal player, i came here to acomplish what i started a year ago. what we started, Sabbing, chozo, creepy, me and many others. this wont have anny ''big effect'' and not long term one as well but you know, a castle 
Page 1: is made of thousand rocks so slowly we add them one by one. in case you dont already see it, im about to fly away like a damn phoenix, litterally, like in movies with a big ball'o fire.i would like to thank alot of people on here that helped me from 
Page 2: different ways ( money, materials'n shit) to help me get my achievement. If you didnt noticed yet, people are more and more complaining about the lag and you need to restart the survival world really often. this all caused by the 14 lag machine hiden all 
Page 3: arround the surviavl world ( mostly near towns and where most player go) they go from bed rock to near the surface. about 45 blocks long, these are 2 rows of pistons pushing gravel/sand. and that powered by a speeding clock. hope you guys find them soon. 
Page 4: (or not) Also, i went thru well know towns and spawned couple of withers, destroying and killing everything around. not much but still a brick in the fucking castle as i said earlier. by the end of all that, i strongly suggest you to change server, to
Page 5: stop playing minecraft or even just go on this server instead (199.192.79.10) in case you didnt got it, its sabbing's server. as She started her military service, i want to give her the gift of getting back all the fans she lost because of Mumblerit shity
Page 6: attitude toward his staff. I had a server for some time and even if im not that experimented, i know there are things thats you DONT say to people, even if you dont know them ''irl'' shit still hurt thru that screen. And maybe thats why toboein left
Page 7: you mumble, maybe she was tired about how you treat people and look at them as if they were all dummies or shit you have to clean on your sidewalk. and so did Fvqu and probably many other staff i didnt know or dont remember. From all those people,
Page 8: (tehsabbingslayer,Chozo4, Creepy, Toboein, Fvqu, all exadiawind players and me are telling you a big 
''Fuck you asshole'' and sincerly mean it. you would definitively know what it like to take something in the ass. so yeah, for your future experiences,
Page 9: stop treating your staff like shit, stop behing homophobic and try to know your server better, you stopped interacting with players and thats what will kill this place, your attitude... this book will be send to all presently connected players and will be
Page 10: market if some need it. i hope you folks realize and for the last time, Fuck you.

[3 Minutes Before]
 Twas 3 minutes before it all came down. I was sitting on the couch sweat beaten wearing nothing when I heard it coming. It opened the door, and turned out to be Puar. It came with a thrust all over my bust. 
Page 4: [Present]
I saw the Meteor flying down, ready for impact, and knew I had to stop it. I planned slowly and carefully, aligning my mouth perfectly to it. There was sweat on my chin when the red throbbing meteors head landed in my mouth. I knew this would be
Page 5: too much for one person to handle, as it was nearly 4 inches from the ground. The Meteor picked a target of it's taste, a busty tan girl with brown hair, that goes by the name of nrokin. It thrusted back and forth, and I had to act quickly if I wanted to 
Page 6: take down this meteor. I quickly pulled out my tracfone while battling this beast and texted my best friend Vic. You could describe her as very pale, but not as busty, with beautiful hair. She hurried over as fast as she could to help take down this
Page 7: meteor before we could put more people at risk. Victoria and I battled for the head of the meteor, trying our best to take turns, although the meteor kept beating us with it's stick, trying to tell us that it only has a couple of minutes left. That only
Page 8: meant we had to work harder and harder to take it down, and that's when it happened, the meteor exploded into a giant white shower of amazingness all over our faces, and we licked off eachothers faces, spitting it into eachother's mouths. We then finished
Page 9: it off by swallowing. They then spend the next hour or so entertaining themselves in ways TehSabbingSlayer would have enjoyed. They know it won't be the last meteor, so they will always be ready to take down another together, otherwise the whole
Page 10: world is at risk. The tale ends with two bare women feeling accomplishment in their life, very happy with the award they earned. Who knows how many meteors they will have to take on during the weekend...

26? Potion of Poision
27? Potion of Weakness 28? 
Page 4:      Introduction
=================== Welcome to potion brewing! If you're new, keep in mind that you need a brewing stand, glass bottles filled with water, and many ingredients, which vary depending on what type of potion you may want to create.
Page 5:      Introduction
=================== Every brewing stand has the capability to hold at maximum three bottles at a time, meaning you can make 3 potions for every single ingredient you add. Keep this in mind!
Page 6:   Base Ingredients
=================== These ingredients start all potions.
------------------- ?Nether Wart
?Glowstone Dust
?Redstone
?Fermented Spider Eye [Adding these to a water bottle will create a base potion. see page 11]
Page 7: Secondary Ingredients =================== ?Magma Creme
?Sugar
?Glistering Melon
?Spider Eye
?Ghast Tear
?Blaze Powder
?Fermented Spider Eye
?Golden Carrot

=================== Add these to a potion to alter their effects. -------------------?Redstone
[Increases duration]
?Glowstone Dust
[Increases potency]
?Gunpowder
[Turns into a splash]
?Fermented Spider Eye
[See next page]
Page 9:   Effect Corruption
=================== Fermented Spider Eyes will change a potion's base effect, often reversing it or producing a negative potion. A "corrupted" potion usually does the opposite of the original potion.
Page 10:       Base Potions
=================== Base potions, much like base ingredients, are the basis of all potions. These are the potions created by simply a watter bottle and a base ingredient together.

	Title: Cow's Tale: Ch1
	Author: XxChaosIncxX
	Type: Written

Page 0: §9Prologue:

§0Despite the downpour,
Chaos boldy ventured
on into the woeful
valley of
blackened elms.

The sopping sounds of
his splashing feet
echoed into the still,
rain-drenched woods.
Page 1: The burdens he bore
were great, not only
those on his
back, but those of the
heavy toll of sin on
his soul.

Everyone. Not a single
peasant spared. He
mused over his
decision to kill
everyone that looked
like the damned.
Page 2: "Perhaps my judgement
was too harsh. Yes,
that woman really
meant no harm."

He chuckled in
remembrance of the
mass slaughter in the
peaceful hamlet.
Chaos was a hearty
paladin-cow.
Page 3: He didn't stop to think
as he systematically
purged the entire
town.
Penance must be paid

He was on a spiritual
quest to cleanse his
sins he had done in
the company of the
alluring man mage,
Zhalfir.
Page 4: §6Chapter 1

§5-Seven weeks ago, the
hour of the
tendercrisp bacon elf
sandwich.
Page 5: Leaning on the
banister of the
dwarven trade ship,
Chaos saw the Mage's
mighty tower from at
least three fortnight's
walks.

The knight-errant
Chaos had recieved an
ultimatum from the
Dwarven Council.
Page 6: The council were the
rulers of the kingdom
Stoutschmeckle.

Chaos was a simple
man-cow; a mercenary
with a fancy title, and
was by far no means
a hero. He sported a
draping moustache, his
bedraggled hair the
typical burly brown of
his highland homeland.
Page 7: His armor was of
modest leather and
iron, and by chance an
unadorned steel cap
sat atop his head.

No true knight was he.

His equipment
consisted of a sturdy
black mace and a
round shield adorned
with a blue spiral.
Page 8: An ample sack covered
his cape, full of
whimsical odds and
ends necessary for
survival in the world in
which he resided.

The nights were long
and the days were hot,
but in time the sea
voyage met its end.
Page 9: Upon arrival, Chaos
strolled off of the
gangway and onto
solid ground.

The wind whipped up
from the grey ocean
as he beheld the
impressive edifice in
its full glory.
Page 10: Grim clouds slowly
whirled about the top
of the looming
structure, as if by
some...magical force,
perhaps.

He trundled toward
the base of the tower,
and shambled up the
incline to the
entrance.
Page 11: Chaos paused upon
the last step on the
top of the cascading
stairway that led to a
somber, shale door
set in the base of the
stupendous monolith.

A feeling of doubt
washed over him,
quickly being shook
away, knowing he must
press on.
Page 12: He forged his iron will
anew into steel and
reached for the goblin
shaped knocker on the
left of a similar, troll
headed one. 

He recoiled in horror
when the statue's
eyes rolled about
madly.
Page 13: 
"Wahts we got here
Elliott?" the sentient
copper goblin giggled.

"I thinks its fresh
meat for the master."
squealed Elliott the
troll head.
Page 14: Shat-tap, bitch. You
sound like a shrieking
milkmaid who's just
seen a barewolf!
Page 15: "Oh, certainly," replied
the goblin. "But we are
only here to forewarn
the supple fools who
Master lures in.
Secure your ass
plate, noble knight! For
Master desires
manflesh more than
anything these days.

But business is
business, so says I.
Page 16: So enter, but 
remember us well.

For we are the only
pair of knockers you'll
ever see in this tower!
Hee Hee!"

The two copper beings
parted to the sides as
the gates swung
open.
Page 17: Chaos set forth in
determination. He
passed through the
foreboding entrance
and came upon a
crossroads.

Three halls diverged,
marked by troubling,
leering gargoyles. The
left probed deep into
the innermost clutches
of the burly ground.
Page 18: The one ahead
consisted of a
seemingly endless
hallway. The rightmost
path led up a
mesmerizing staircase.

Chaos' keen snout
sensed a moist wind
emanating from the
spiral staircase.
Page 19: Knowing that the
master wizard. Zhalfir
could only exist in a
solid state in sopping
climes, he turned and
began to ascend the
staircase.
Page 20: "Ware the seductions
of Master," the goblin
echoed from behind.
"Even the straightest
arrow can be bent!"

After the warning,
Elliott let loose a
squeal that sounded a
little bit like a fire
hose sprayed through
an electric fan filled
with pelicans and -
Page 21: whistling track
coaches who had a
little too much time on
their hands and liked
to play tug of war
behind the snack
shack but one day the
tennis kids came by
and tipped it over,
subsequently trapping
them in the tomblike
waste wallow and he
hated his life
Page 22: and all the days after
no one looked at him
quite the same way, not
even his family and
that's what Elliott's
scream sounded like.

Chaos ventured
deeper into the
labyrinthine halls. As
he progressed, he
began to fall into
a dreamlike state.
Page 23: The winding corridors
seemed to shift as
inexplicable enigmas
danced within his
primitive manbrain.

His rhythmic footsteps
were punctuated by
mysterious sounds;
sudden soft laughter,
or the quiet shutting
of a door.
Page 24: He felt a singular
sense of disquiet as
he strode ever
quicker down the
corridor, fighting the
trancelike waves of
unreality.

He was suddenly
aware of a vast
presence behind him,
and he whirled
around.
Page 25: Shield set and mace
drawn back, but
nothing was there, and
Chaos began to doubt
his own sanity.

§7(Certainly it wasn't
there in the first
place because he kills
a shit load of innocent
people.)
Page 26: Then a notion arose.
Perhaps Chaos was
not really wandering
the halls, not even
moving. Gods! 

He was wandering
within his own mind! He
must get back to
consciousness right
now, lest he wake up
with a sore ass.
Page 27: He struggled through
the blurring mire of
the dreamworld, trying
to reach out for
consciousness.

Finally, with all of his
will, he snapped back
awake, and found
himself in a dim, velvet
room.
Page 28: His armor covered in
rose petals, but
thankfully still on.

>
Page 3: Step 4
Breeding
Chickens  >Seeds
Pigs > Carrots
Cows > Wheat
Sheep > Wheat
Mooshroom > Wheat

it takes 3-5 minecraft days to grow up fully
Page 4: Step 5
Protection
Griefers love to kill animals . Protect them with enclosed pens and land protection . They cant kill what they cant reach
Keep in mind , animals despawn . So harvest or slaughter quickly

>
Page 5: Step 6
Pokeballs
Mutts uses a plugin that allows you to gather animals with less than half health . just throw an egg at them when they are below half . Always save 2 spawn eggs to restart your farms

	Title: 2 years of mutts
	Author: Emerl7
	Type: Written

Page 0: Ah, i still remember that first day, when i logged onto muttsworld for the very, first, time.
About two years back? Yes, around that time.
I had first heard of the server through my friend, Zomgpig, who was my best freind. 
when i logged on there was a
Page 1: test, on the rules of the server, my friend gave me all the answers, but it was easy and i could have done it in under a minute.
I was still in the defalt skin, and so was he, as we roamed past the briliant lights and creations, there was only one server
Page 2: of muttsworld at the time, unlike today, where we have PVP, creative, and skyblock.

There was so much creation, and briliance back then that you don't see today.
jokes laughter and joy its self seemed to spring out of everything.
Page 3: For muttsworld, was the first server i had ever joined, and it will stay that way forever. at last, we finaly found a little island, it was flat and had oak growing on it. just behind a large mountion. i dug a hole in the ground while zomg got wood, and
Page 4: soon we were on our feet and prospering.
we never left that hole as long as we stayed there, we kept making it biger.
it was just after the potion relese that it happend. zomgpig struck platinum. an old player, or maybe mod had givin up. he had no need
Page 5: for his castle anymore, and offered it to Zomgpig. for free. unfortualty, there were no regions at the time, so we had to buy diplomat to teleport there and back to move! ah, i can still remember that hole.
the time we found an abondond mine under it, and
Page 6: we ran into a cave spider spawner for the first time. we nearly craped out pixilated pants. we didn't know what it was, and at the time, you couldn't break a spawner, unless you had dinamite.
i had zomgpig hole off the spiders while i ran up stairs and
Page 7: crafted some. he didn't know what i was doing, so when i lit the dinamite and ran, he went to go see what i did. haha, he nearly died that day, and went on spamming the chat box with screaming and yelling that i almost killed him. i miss those days.
Page 8: But back to the castle. it was HUGE. i mean, 4 times bigger than second spawn, it was amazing. it had the first floor, which was just decoration, the second, which was the tresurey, third, the garden, where there were no potatos or carrots then, but we 
Page 9: had everything else.
then the forth floor, where you over looked the garden and saw the entire world before your eyes. And underneath it all, was a tree farm, as big as the castle itself.

But sometimes i regret the desision to move there, for, we already
Page 10: had everything made for us. they hadn't made an update in months, and we had already done everything. Zomg had gotten bord, and gaven up... he left the server forever, only loging on every once and a while to talk to me. i still had faith that something
Page 11: would happen.
people i knew left the server one after the other. the only people i know now are a few of the staff, and even some have left that too. 
But then it happend! Then new patch for the nether! there waz quartz and all sorts of new things,
Page 12: even stuff to redstone! i now had so much to do, upgrade the farms with hoppers and pistons, i went mineing again, got hidden minerals from my mine, and i was haveing fun! i let people a few freinds come and stay in the castle every once and a while and
Page 13: it was amazing!
One time, i got to go to the original spawn, thats right, the very first spawn of muttsworld. it was alot duller than i expected. but still, it was cool.

Then, the second greatist fight of my life happend. The wither release happend. So i
Page 14: got a friend of mine and we gathered our armour, swords and bows to get ready to fight. i build an obsidian chamber to hold it, and build the summoning pole.

my friend stood behind me, and we placed the three heads.
Page 15: There was an explosion! and i was blasted back, but still alive. I charged right to the wither with my diamond sword in hand and struck him twice, stumbling him back. he then shot explosive heads at me, and i dodged one, but the other hit me! then there
Page 16: was a poison of somekind that ignored my armour! as my friend was holding him back, i looked at where the other head hit, and the obsidean had exploaded! i completely forgot! the only thing that can withstand a wither explosion is bed rock!
Page 17: soon the wither flew out of the chamber, exploading everything in site. me and my friend jumped out, pulled out our bows and started shooting.
It chased us.
we took turns distracting it, one ran and the other shot, we did this a few times untill it
Page 18: directed its attention to the sheep inside my castle! he started shooting my castle! i jumped up and shot him, and he chased me again. while looping around he shot my home time and time again. he eventually landed a direct hit, killing me instantly.
Page 19: i respawned on the other side, inside my castle, when he came exploading in! i punched him with my 302 unarmed skill, and ran out through the hole he made.
i grabed my stuff as my freind distracted him, and heard the sound that said it all.
Page 20: He killed it! it was finaly dead! And we got the prize we were after.
The nether star.
I quickly crafted it into a beacon and left it in a chest, makeing sure it was safe, we started on the repairs, makeing the entrance with a balcony, and the walls 
Page 21: good as new.
I made a full power beacon, and put it in the center of the castle. unfortunaly... back then the beacon range was horrible.
it couldn't even reach the garden.
we both thought that it wasn't even worth it.
untill they upgraded it!
Page 22: now it went to the forth floor! 
It was amazing, and was alot of work.
though, it wasnt over.
this time, we had an army.
some friends of my friends grouped in an abandoned village. We were going at it once more, after the same prize.
Page 23: only, this time. it was much worse.

i got in my enchanted diamond armour and got my weapons.
when it spawned, i forgot about the explosion and ended up dieing before i could even attack.
when i arived, the place was in ruins,
Page 24: everbody was hideing under a building and trying to gather there things without diening
we had to mine for more resorses to kill it, and we knew that if we didn't, it would escape and go on a griefing rampage.
the fight lasted 1 hour.
and then the server
Page 25: restarted. it was a matanince, and it was 30 min untill we could relog.
when i got back on, the others were still fighting. it was still on.

it was another hour untill we gave up.
another hour of endless fighting and argueing.
Page 26: We called in a mod to delete it.
heh, i still remember that day. we got a scolding and went home. it was fun, but hard.
a few weeks later, this guy kept asking for help building this ship of his.
I thought i had nothing better to do, so
Page 27: i decided to help him build his ship.
he managed to get like ten people helping him. we made a farm in the air and the entire ship was made of wool.
he had a huge sheep farm on it, they were packed together like two animals breeding.
i cant remember how
Page 28: many there were. because i couldnt count them.
I was expanding a part of the ship, when one of the admins slaped a bunch of people. and i was one of them. i thought i was gonna die, because i was already above 100 blocks, and now 100 more. i managed to
Page 29: miss hiting land by 2 blocks and hit water, just barely alive.
ha, it was fun, though i had 25 lvls, so i didn't want to die.

Then. it happend.
Page 30: 
Page 31: Most of you probably dont know, seeing as how most of muttsworld players left the server perminatly.
there used to be 2 admins.
Mumberlit
and
TehSabbingSlayer
tho most called her sabbing
Page 32: sabbing and mumble got in a big fight, and it ended up with sabbing being exiled, but the world map, being deleted.
yes. the castle, that village, my old home, everything was gone.
all my stats were reset as well, and nothing was the same.
Page 33: i played on mutts for a bit... then gave up.
i finaly, let it go. i tried other servers, but they wernt as fun.
then Minecraft came out on the xbox, and noobs invaded it. xbox ruined minecraft for me, it was horrible.

untill a week ago, when i decided to
Page 34: drop by for a visit, and traveld to the edge of the world, where i am right now, writeing this book.
i'm rebuilding my castle. right now. rebuilding my stats too. and. hopeing. minecraft will dull down, and the noobs will grow up. there will always be
Page 35: noobs, and thats not bad, just not too much of them.

 A Home of Snow

 by BlackDewn
Page 1: 

Once there was a wolf living at the hill

with all around built he decided to demolish his previous home to transform it into something better..
Page 2: .
After an overdose of inspiration he started sholveling entire biomes to achieve his goal

Finally he got what he wanted but with a cost

He wasnt able...
to store all his goodies anymore, just a part
Page 3: 
but the home looked pretty well tho



[Finished the last day of 2013]

The interesting place


by Black Dewn

Once the wolf dreamed about a place for everyone to explore.

to jump, to get lost, to get found, to get all
Page 2: 
then he started to build this place

a place he just called

An interesting place

Sea Home

Once there was a wolf who lived by the sea

he managed to be here by escaping the griefers who destroyed his starter house


Page 2: 

As the time passed he built more and more floors underground with everything he wanted
in such a small size
Page 3: 

everything he wanted except for one thing


...someone to be with

Starter House


by Black Dewn
Page 1: 

The wolf once built his house really high in the sky

a fortress to be safe from evil people with dark hearts
Page 2: 

That was not enough and griefers still came, 
so the wolf has to left everything he loved and go to find a new home

leaving this place behind
Page 3: 
(this is a replica of the wolf´s first home ever built in this server

originally on top of a tree)

Sky Home

By Black Dewn
Page 1: 

Once there was a wolf living in the sky.

the skyblock server was a peaceful place to stay, so the wulfy made a home
Page 2: it rendered as smooth as it could be and had not much

but what he had was enough to live a peaceful progressive life
Page 3: he thought he was all alone until he changed his settings to far and noticed he was not alone

far away there were little homes at equal distance each one from another

with people leaving the same way...
Page 4: as the wolfy was leaving 


as an eternal grid above the eternal void

Page 0: From childhoods hour I have not been
As others wereI have not seen
As others sawI could not bring
My passions from a common spring
From the same source I have not taken
My sorrowI could not awaken
Page 1: My heart to joy at the same tone
And all I lovdI lovd alone
Thenin my childhoodin the dawn
Of a most stormy lifewas drawn
From evry depth of good and ill
The mystery which binds me still
Page 2: From the torrent, or the fountain
From the red cliff of the mountain
From the sun that round me rolld
In its autumn tint of gold
From the lightning in the sky
As it passd me flying by

And the cloud that took the form
(When the rest of Heaven was blue)
Of a demon in my view

I have spent the day looking for food and shelter. The days are short and the nights seem long.
I've managed to rough out a crude shack made or earth. tomorrow I will make some crude tools and try to construct a 
Page 1: more sturdy shelter. Perhaps out of wood or stone. 

Day 2 The night was harrowing. Monsters prowed close to the hut. I could hear the clacking of bones. I have no idea what is out there waiting for me in the darkness, I just hope these dirt walls hold...

------------
The sun was leaving a pink glow in the sky as it set before them. The waves were crashing against the rocks and they just sat on a blanket taking it all in. "Avenger..." Schnuffels said softly. "Yes?"
Page 1: "Oh nothing...". Schnuffels just longed to hold his hand. Only inches from his. It felt so easy to just reach over and grab it.. but the thought of being rejected upset his stomach.  Avenger looked into his eyes and shouted "AM I CUTE!"
Page 2: Schnuffels looked at him confused and stuttered  "Ye-yeah.. you're adorable.". 
"Haha, you know just what to say to make me blush!" Avenger mocked. Silence took place for a few moments before schnuffels just grabbed his hand stiffly and held it 
Page 3: tightly. "Schnuffels! What are you doing!"
.....
....
"Your hands! They looked so nice. I couldn't help myself... You look so sexy tonight." Schnuffels responded in his cute Swedish accent. 
Page 4: "But Schnuffels! Shadowgirlxx is my care friend!"

"I don't care about her! Fuck me right now!" He demanded.
Avenger stood there speechless taking the situation in. He knew Shadowgirlxx stopped giving him the xxx...
Page 5: he nodded his head and stood up. "Fine. As long as you promise to not tell Shadowgirlxx." Schnuffels quickly got on his knees and unzipped Avengers pants. His small sausage popped out and Schnuffels eagerly lapped at it. It didn't grow in size...
Page 6: It was maybe 3 inches hard. Schnuffels didn't care though, he just knew he wanted to pleasure him. He continued to lap at his pickle. He slipped a finger in his fanny and Avenger came. Hot juice squirted all over Schnuffels face. 
Page 7: "Wow. You're so fast! That wasn't even a minute!" Schnuffles complained. "I ugh... I have a... premature ejaculation problems..." Avenger felt embarrased and zipped up his pants. He grabbed his bag and walked away.
Page 8: "AVENGER! COME BACK! I LOVE YOU!" Schnuffles screamed.  But Avenger kept walking. Days past and Schnuffles still didn't hear back from Avenger. "I guess he's gone..." Schnuffles couldn't stand it and overdosed on asprin.

___________________2: What is enchanting?

3: How to enchant

4: The best enchants
Page 1: If you've experienced survival Minecraft before, you should know what enchanting is. If not, enchanting is a "game of luck" in order to gain buffs on weapons, tools, and armor. In order to enchant, you must acquire an enchantment table and bookshelves.
Page 2: To fully experience the glory of enchanting, you need a total of 1 enchantment table, 20 bookshelves and however many lapis lazuli. To enchant, right-click the enchantment table to open a window. Place in your item, add lapis, pick an enchant, and viola!
Page 3: The luckiest of enchants would most likely be Fortune, this allows you to get more items from what you mined/broke. Another lucky enchant is silk touch, which allows you to pick up spawners and glass without breaking them. Lucky enchants for weapons would
Page 4: be looting, allowing you to get more drops from each mob you kill. Good armor enchants are protection and aqua infinity.
Page 5: More will be coming from the tutorial handbooks of Neskah and tatertot07637. Look on the market to find our latest books!

Page 0: How to make:

Fire Resistance Potion

Ingredients:
-Water Bottle
-Nether Wart
-Magma Cream
-Brewing Stand

Optional:
-Gunpowder
Page 1: 1.

  The first thing you have to do is go to a brewing stand with a water bottle and put the water bottle in the slot and a nether wart above it. The water bottle becomes an Awkward Potion.
Page 2: 2.

  Keep the Awkward Potion where it is and in the slot above it, place magma cream (crafted using blaze powder and a slime ball) in it. The potion becomes a Fire Resistance potion.
Page 3: 3. (optional)

  Keep the Fire Resistance potion where it is, and add gunpowder above it. The potion is now a splash potion.

Page 0: Day 1 of Gust3                                       Today it was busy for me (well sort of). We played Hide n' Seek with calemvir_eldion, Sclopetator and Arizyung. They left and im working on more buildings here in Gust3 the new name of the region here.
Page 1: Day 2 of Gust3                                       I made a cat farm for breeding. That didn't really turn out well. Sammich98 came and spawned a whole bunch of them in the breeding place and lagged the whole place! Weird and ironic.
Page 2: Day 3 of Gust3                                       Puppyuppy and I do a movie called "The Corruption". Pretty obvious its about a corruption spreading city to city. I suggested Pokemon people in there too so we did. It's very fun and mysterious too.
Page 3: Day 4 of Gust3
                            I made a villager breeding complex near apton's house. Of course i put an iron golum to protect them from zombies and other stuff. I aslo became ambassador 2 weeks ago. Pretty neat huh? 
Page 4: Day 5 of Gust3                                       Today i made 3 pwarps. 1 in purpleowl1040's temple. 2nd in moga_villager's castle. 3rd in Tanks n' Things. My pwarps r free cuz im ambassador. My friends suggusted my titles to be ambassatank.
Page 5: Day 6 of Gust3                                       Today me and calemvir_eldion got in a big fight. he wanted to know y i keep lying to him. ill never tell him or Sclopetator. im so pissed at him. i removed him off the friends list thank god. 
Page 6: Day 7 in Gust3                                       It's been sometime in survival. I remember the great times i had when i first entered mutts. I had so much fun with my old friends. I met new ones, lots come and go and lots of changes.
Page 7: Day 8 of Gust3

If you're reading this, dear fellow reader, I suggest to continue being awesome. Even you calemvir_eldion. I still live in Gust3, which is a boodyful region. Might as well come on down to live here.
Page 8: Day 9 in Gust3

Been working hard on my castle. Some player wanted me to give him tips for being an ambassador. I'm just upset i haven't been made mod yet. I hope i do soon, i will help like no one else has! :D
Page 9: Day 10 of Gust3

It's been awhile. Haven't played much survival lately :/. Busy with creative sometimes

-------------------By Chazzapower
Page 1: On a beautiful morning a young purple dinosaur walked into the survival portal of MuttsWorld, he joined eager to socialize with his friends. He joins with a quiet "Hey guys" and was immediately abused by Tnt378 dropping over 58 times dying from each
Page 2: teleport, Then the little Dino was sad, but still wanted to make ammends with his favourite admin toboein, his offer of kindness and non-spamming was immediately destroyed by this unforgiving admin, though he knew he made this happen from all the spamming
Page 3: he had done requesting the admin to build all his shit for him.
Later the roaring dino, starting to get real tired with everyone's fucking bullshit, decides to talk to his new friend VictoriaAucoin, she ignored the dinosaur.
Then fucked off to 
Page 4: L2D where she punished noobs, including Chazzapower. Then after frustration, the dino goes to his 2nd last "friend" Darkness293,
Darkness called chazza a fucking noob slut then left for creative.
Page 5: After being shut down by all his known friends he goes to his last resort for friendship and fun, TehSabbingSlayer, his best friend.


Oh wait.

"The Little Duckling" was tired of life, and
Page 6: said he would never talk to anyone ever again, then talked later that evening. Then the bullying and abuse came for round 2, and for eternity.
Then one day many years later from continuous abuse, he said "Fuck this" and left forever.

Page 0: THE RISE OF HUNTMANJ'S EMPIRE

  This is an account of my empire's rise in Muttsworld. It began with my settlement of Spawnpoint. From there I built out of the city to form what is now Bayside Village. My citizens
Page 1: do not know that they are a part of my rise yet, but as they help me construct a massive castle they will soon understand. Since I founded Bayside, I am by default the mayor/king of it. I will use this to take over other areas 
Page 2: and expand my kingdom. It is only a matter of time. With my mega-mine I am constructing deep beneath my castle I will be able to continue the growth of my town. The first target is Spawnpoint. I already own a majority of the 
Page 3: property there. I will continue to make roads to and from Spawnpoint and eventually totally rename the village. I will 'invite' many people from Global Chat to come live here, in a self-sustaining village. We will have shops and all 
Page 4: necessary goods and resources. The HMJ Kingdom will never stop, and I will never give up this goal. May God be with us all in this dangerous time. 
Page 5:    I believe conquest of spawnpoint will be easy. Very few residents if any at all. Bayside Will for sure declare rule over it today, Feb. 20. It will start with the building of a new road into Spawnpoint. Then the name of that 
Page 6: entire town will be changed, making Bayside Village nearly triple in size.

After an hour of flirting Wolf made her move and said: "How about you and me, in that bathroom?" Lockette was a little shocked and thought to herself: "well Royal can't satisfied me, what the hell we only live 
Page 4: once"thinking she was going to get laid by a boy Lockette agreed. After Wolf gave Lockette a tongue kiss they walked to the woman's bathroom.

chapter 2: Surprise! I do got balls

After they got into the bathroom, Lockette
Page 5: locked the door and starts to kiss Wolf. Not breaking the kiss, Wolf slowly pushes Lockette into the wall. With no way out Lockette gets undressed by wolf. After taking Lockette's shirt and bra off, it was Wolf's time to get some undress by Lockette. As
Page 6: Lockette removed the wolf pelt she was shocked. It wasn't a man naked under the wolf pelt, but a female! Lockette was disappointed and told Wolf she wanted a real man to fuck her not a woman. Disappointed wolf looked away for a second and notice a small 
Page 7: hole in the wall. As she looked through the hole, she could see a part of someones face. She recognized the face, it was Echo the moderator who triend to burn the book that she was writing about DiabloBlade. Wolf spends lots of time writing about 
Page 8: DiabloBlade's amazing penis and gets wet as she thinks about it. But now she didn't have time to think about DiabloBlade's cock as she saw a great chance to get revenge on Echo and proof that she can be above any man. Wolf signed Echo to put his penis 
Page 9: through the hole. As horny as Echo was he put his penis through the hole. Suddenly Wolf got her wooden sword and cut Echo's penis clear off with great ease. It was easy to do with a wooden sword, because Echo' penis wasn't big at all. As Echo was
Page 10: Screaming from the pain, Wolf yells: "How about that for payback? bitch!!!" Wolf picked up the cut off penis and flush it down the toilet as she yells: "Who's the man now?!" Echo ran out of the bar crying. Lockette was so amazed at this experience she 
Page 11: gave the lesbian experience a change.

chapter 3: I fucked a girl and i loved it!

Lockette's still only wearing her skirt and agreed to the lesbian experience. She walked to Wolf and gave her a tongue kiss lasting for at least a minute. Wolf
Page 12: was surprised by Lockette' reaction and told Lockette to lean forward and put her hands òn the wall. Lockette felt exposed and arched het back slightly, tempting Wolf to touch het body. Slowly Wolf removed the tiny skirt covering Lockette's lower parts.
Page 13: All that's between Lockette and Wolf now is the thin little black strip of Lockette's panties. Lockette found herself hoping Wolf would pull them off before she gets them too wet to wear. Wolf hooked her nails into the panties at the hips and pulls them 
Page 14: down. Lockette' legs are parted enough that they only get halfway down her thighs before they pull tight. Lockette arches het back further, pushing her ass out towards Wolf saying: "i want you to touch me, i want your fingers on me, i want your mouth on
Page 15: me. Anything. I just want you touching me. My naked pussy is right in front of you and i can feel you breathing." While she said that Lockette was wondering if Wolf was touching herself. The thought of this made Lockette even hornier. She imagines Wolf
Page 16: standig behind her with her finger rubbing her pussy while she watches all that is exposed in front of her. then Wolf touches Lockette` Her hand feels up between Lockette's legs with a form confidence that made Lockette gasp (sound effect). Suddenly Wolf
Page 17: presses her finger into Lockette and Lockette push back against Wolf's hand. Wolf is ruthless. She pushes her finger straight in as deep and far as her finger could reach and Lockette finds herself gasping and couldn't even cry out (sound effect). Then 
Page 18: Wolf fucked Lockette with her hand.
Two fingers thrust in and out so quickly that Lockette could feel her heels skimming on the floor. Lockette lowered her head and pushed her arms against the wall, curling on her toes just hoping she wouldn't fall. Wolf
Page 19: shoved her hand in harder, fucking Lockette so rough, that her hand slaps on Lockette's ass with each thrust. Lockette's legs are trembling and she can hear her heels tapping irregularly on the floor like drums by drummer on drugs. Lockette leans
Page 20: further forward, her forearms resting vertically on the wall, het elbows banging against the wall. Lockette can't help, but let out a little noise. Lockette thought it would be a moan but it turned out to be more like a growl once it escaped her
Page 21: throat (sound effect). Wolf pushes her thumb between the cheeks of Lockette's ass and rock hard against her like she is trying to lift her off her feet using het pussy as a handhold. Wolf puts the fingers of her other hand right on Lockette's clit. The 
Page 22: fingers in Lockette's pussy suddenly hooked up towards her stomach. Lockette wanted to cum so badly. She wanted it so bad that she can't even form the words to tell Wolf.Lockette's hands are grabbing aimlessly against the wall and her legs are shaking.
Page 23: Lockette thought she might fall. She might just topple down against the toilet.
She continues thinking: "Would you lean down and continue to fuck me if i fell? i can't take the risk, i want to cim so bad". Lockette wanted to take a hand off the wall so 
Page 24: she could grab her breasts and press them hard agaunst her ribs. The orgasm hit Lockette like an atom bomb (sound effect), a deep hot glow that spread and almost consumed her whole body in flame. Lockette felt like a shell of render skin, around a
Page 25: fireball that threatened to consume her. Wolf must of have felt Lockette cumming, because she stopped thrusting and pressed her hand firmly against lockette, holding her steady while she orgasm. Lockette's legs are so shaky that she has to remain leaning 
Page 26: on the wall even after Wolf withdrew her hands. After a few moments of catching her breath and balance she manages to stand up. Lockette can feel her cheeks flushed, throat sweet and she's sure that she is glowing cherry red. Lockette turned to face Wolf
Page 27: and Wolf pressed her wet fingers against Lockette's lips. Lockette kissed them and take them into her mouth. She could taste her own pussy on Wolf' fingers. Lockette's breathing is still unsteady (sound effect), Lockette's lips trembled against Wolf's 
Page 28: hand. Wolf licked her lips and smiled. Lockette wanted to kiss Wolf but she didn't trust herself to mave just yet.
Lockette cleaned herself up a but, before pulling her wet panties up. Lockette goes to the wash basin and splashes a little water on her 
Page 29: face and fixes her hair. Afterwhich Lockette and Wolf got dressed. Before Lockette left through the door, Wolf kissed her and said "next time you may satisfy me" and gave Lockette a card with her number. Wolf left the bathroom and the bar. About 5 minutes
Page 30: Lockette also left the bathroom and the bar.
While Lockette was typing "/home" she thought to herself: "How to pay Wolf back for making me so exposed".

§0I know we all got off to a wrong start.§0

§0I will inform her of your "sorry".§0
§0We do wish for you to not cause trouble and to call people mean things.

§0Please remember that if you feel you can say sorry to us when we're online, please do.§0
§0Snore and the rest of us are not happy.§0
§0We have resulted to placing traps and hiding our animals so

§0However,§0
§0I do know that you have been kicked out of many villages, you don't deserve that.§0
§0But you didn't follow any of Sanford's rules that are there
Page 3: to protect people and animals, plus make Sanford a lovely place to live.§0
§0And when I logged on this morning, you were in the village. I didn't say anything because I was wondering what you were doing.§0
§0I saw the message and read it. But you did leave
Page 4: the gates open, which is asked not to do in the rules.§0
§0Anyway,§0
§0I accept your appology but the others might not.§0
§0Until they do, please stay away from the village and try not to cause any trouble, that way they will be more likely
Page 5: to accept you.§0
§0Good look with everything.§0

§0My name is WolfGirl1901, but you can just call me Wolf.§0
§0You are lucky to have found this time capsule, I doubt anyone would have ever seen this if it wasn't for you.
Page 1: Anyway, I have been on this server for over a year, I first started with my friend, pink_amy.§0
§0I have made many friends on this server, like ap240694 who was banned at one point, mattamaster7, haxhaxbear, MCExpert02 who is now called DatMCE and lots more.
Page 2: I have also brought some of my real life friends to join this server, like MasonBieter, NetherDestroyer2, Toxic_Puppy and more. I am also friends with pink_amy in real life too.§0
§0Thank you for reading.§0

Page 0:       The URUs§0
§0
§0The URU is one of the rarest types of horse. The URU means: Ultra Rare Undead§0
§0or their full name:§0
§0The Ultra Rare Undead/Zombie Horse, shortened it would be the TURUZH, but that's a bit of a long name.
Page 1: At my farm... oh, I never told you my name! My name is WolfGirl1901, or Wolf for short.§0
§0I own Axe14/Vale15 horse stud, where I breed, sell, buy and rescue all kinds of horses!§0
§0So, at my farm, I'm selling URUs. Just keep in mind that
Page 2: the URUs are the most rare horse in Mutts. At the minute, there are only four of these horses that exist. I own two of them, my friend owns one and another friend owns another.§0
§0I am selling these horses for 25k each. If you are good with§0
§0animals and
Page 3: horses, I may cheapen the price for you!§0
§0If you have another rare horse, like one with a huge amount of hearts, a huge jump high or that goes really fast. I will halve price to 12,5k. That's if you will give me that horse; or the offspring of that horse.
Page 4: Regular horses: 75 mums each§0
§0Race horses: 125 mums each§0
§0Showjumping horses: 150 mums each§0
§0Skeleton horses: 200 mums each§0
§0Donkeys: 50 mums each§0
§0Mules: 100 mums each§0
§0Ultra Rare Undeads: 12.5k/25k each
Page 5: If you want us to look after your horse, we will! All you have to do is: Message me (if online) or drop us a message in the donations box at Axe15/Vale15 horse stud. /visit Vale15 or Axe14 and simply follow the signs and torches!
Page 6: We take great care of your horse, will train and even take out for frequent rides (if wanted).§0
§0Keep in mind that you don't have to give us permition to ride your horse.§0
§0Here is the time/payment times below!
Page 7: 1 day: 25 mums§0
§01 week: 75 mums§0
§01 month: 200 mums§0
§06 months: 400 mums§0
§01 year: 1500 mum§0
§0So basically 25 mums per day, I will be counting how many days your horse stays with us, and when you come and collect it, I will add up the days and tell
Page 8: you the bill!§0
§0
§0Thank you very much for reading this short article about WolfGirl1901's Axe14/Vale15 horse stud.§0
§0
§0Please re-sell this book for 150 mums!

Page 0: Rkills,

Merry Christmas. This past year has sure been a rollercoaster. Z,B,Kat,Jake and I were so unhappy with where we lived, so we took off on an adverture to find a new place to live. We came across your island and thought it was PERFECT!
Page 1: Only problem was, you lived there. We didn't want to intrude on your land. Staff told us to wait 3 weeks to see if you would come around before we could start building. Fortunately, you never showed. So we invaded. (i still feel super guilty about that)
Page 2: But in all honesty, it was the best thing that could have happened. You are such an amazing person and you have made my time spent on Muttsworld more enjoyable than I thought possible. We have both gone from being players, to now the best staff members
Page 3: Survival has! :P

Cheers to many more memories we will make in the future.

Merry Christmas!

<3 Nicole

4- Horse racing!
5- Spending fair coins
7- The Secert Prize
9- Thank you!
Page 1: Hi and welcome to the fair bank!!! This is the most trustable bank on this server. We can keep track of your money so if u die. No one can take it or so nothing happens to it.
Here is how our fair bank works.
Page 2: If you give us ores, you then get these ponits called "fair coins" which will go in your bank account.

Iron = 2 fair coins
Gold = 3 fair coins
Lapsis = 4 coins
Redstone = 6 coins
Diamonds = 10 coins
Page 3: Hay r u ready to get your game on?! Hi, horse racing can b an amazing sport. In ashleyoolcat5 style of horse racing is simple. If you want to race, it only cost u 1 fair coin. 
When people race, you can bet and try to win coins from others.
Page 4: Here is how betting in a horse race works, you ask ashleycoolcat5 if you and your friend want to make a bet. Then, she will hand you a book to record your bets in so there is no cheating or fighting in the process of betting in the horse racing games.
Page 5: While you r walk or running around the fair, u might want something to eat. NO PROBLEM, when you have fair ponits or ores, u can spend them in the tent area to get food, drinks, or cool items.
Page 6: If u create an account at the fair bank. Then u have a chance to win a super prize!! That prizes can b diamonds too. If you think your not gonna win, then think again because if there r more than 15 people is thee fair the very 1st time it opens. 
Page 7: ashleyoolcat5 will call more than 2 people.
Page 8: Well, THANK YOU so much for read this whole thing. And if u do, thank you for making an account here at the fair! Also the fair coins never expire so u r free to come back when ever and use them again and again. Byee coolcats! ;D

[Verse 1]
Dog goes "woof"
Cat goes "meow"
Bird goes "tweet"
And mouse goes "squeak"
Cow goes "moo"
Frog goes "croak"
And the elephant goes "toot"
Ducks say "quack"

And the seal goes "ow ow ow"

But there's one sound
That no one knows
What does the fox say?

Suddenly you're standing still

So beautiful

But if you meet
A friendly horse
Will you communicate by

The secret of the fox
Ancient mystery
Somewhere deep in the woods
I know you're hiding
What is your sound?
Will we ever know?
Will always be a mystery

You're my guardian angel
Hiding in the woods

Page 0:   Dear Neighbor,
 
  Someone has been minorly greifing our houses, gardens, and even walkways. Its uncalled for and it needs to come to an end. I think the greif is to minor to do a /mod req, so we need to come up with a different solution. 
Page 1: The greifer can be someone from our own village, so we have to be cautious. But us a  neighborhood neeeds to come up with a positive solution.

§0Location:§0
§0Under my (Scaw) house kind of. Path there is near Trading Post. §0
§0

Page 2: Appearance:§0
§0Kona Trench is partly inside of a ravine/mineshaft. It is slightly lit up. Feel free to light it up yourself some more.§0
§0
§0Safety:§0
§0There are hostile mobs in Kona Trench, which is why we require that you bring  a sword when 
Page 3: exploring the depths of the ocean. We also require that you bring a Water Breathing Helmet or some signs to make air pockets. We have made a few air pockets, but we worry that there are not enough for safe passage in and out. §0
§0

Page 4: History:§0
§0Kona Trench was created when scaw broke a sand block while trying to make an underwater room, causing the entire ravine to cave in. It is named Kona Trench after the place in Hawaii.
Page 5: Other:§0
§0Occaisonaly, mlanch or myself will host a tour through the trench. Feel free to explore it yourself or with buddies. You may NOT bring people who are not residents of SS to explore with you withour consent of mlanch or I.

Page 0: Ylvis - The Fox

[Verse 1]
Dog goes "woof"
Cat goes "meow"
Bird goes "tweet"
And mouse goes "squeak"
Cow goes "moo"
Frog goes "croak"
And the elephant goes "toot"
Ducks say "quack"
Page 1: And fish go "blub"
And the seal goes "ow ow ow"

[Pre-Chorus]
But there's one sound
That no one knows
What does the fox say?
Page 2: [Chorus 1]
"Ring-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding!
Gering-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding!
Gering-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding!"
What the fox say?


Page 3: "Wa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pow!
Wa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pow!
Wa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pow!"
What the fox say?

Hatee-hatee-hatee-ho!
Hatee-hatee-hatee-ho!"
What the fox say?
Page 4: "Joff-tchoff-tchoffo-tchoffo-tchoff!
Tchoff-tchoff-tchoffo-tchoffo-tchoff!
Joff-tchoff-tchoffo-tchoffo-tchoff!"
What the fox say?

Page 5: [Verse 2]
Big blue eyes
Pointy nose
Chasing mice
And digging holes
Tiny paws
Up the hill
Suddenly you're standing still
Page 6: [Pre-Chorus 2]
Your fur is red
So beautiful
Like an angel in disguise
But if you meet
A friendly horse
Will you communicate by
Mo-o-o-o-orse?
Mo-o-o-o-orse?
Mo-o-o-o-orse?
Page 7: How will you speak to that
Ho-o-o-o-orse?
Ho-o-o-o-orse?
Ho-o-o-o-orse?

What does the fox say?

"Jacha-chacha-chacha-chow!
Chacha-chacha-chacha-chow!
Chacha-chacha-chacha-chow!"
What the fox say?

Fraka-kaka-kaka-kaka-kow!
Fraka-kaka-kaka-kaka-kow!"
What the fox say?

"A-hee-ahee ha-hee!
A-hee-ahee ha-hee!
A-hee-ahee ha-hee!"
What the fox say?
Page 10: "A-oo-oo-oo-ooo!
Woo-oo-oo-ooo!"
What does the fox say?
Page 11: [Bridge]
The secret of the fox
Ancient mystery
Somewhere deep in the woods
I know you're hiding
What is your sound?
Will we ever know?
Will always be a mystery
What do you say?
Page 12: [Outro]
You're my guardian angel
Hiding in the woods
What is your sound?
(Wa-wa-way-do Wub-wid-bid-dum-way-do Wa-wa-way-do)
Will we ever know?
Page 13: (Bay-budabud-dum-bam)

Page 0: i guess this is journal page one.... lets see, i guess for entry#1, i regained hope in my chase of nicola. it felt impossibe for a while, but maybe it is'nt  actually that impossible.
Page 1: entry #2

i exploded in the mob arena and lost literally all of my armor, but i remade it. still thinking about how i might be able to ask out nicola again, but im having trouble. i have terrible timing...
Page 2: entry #3

i made a boat. havent been able to think of a good time to ask nicola the question, because theres never a stop in the talking at the table and i would feel like a wuss if i asked in the game...
Page 3: entry #4

absolutely nothing has happened. still cant work out the nicola thing, trying to figure that out before summer break.  i pray that i make it in time.
Page 4: entry #5

im starting to think that i might not be good enough. shes never shown any real interest in me and maybe she hates me. i just dont know...
Page 5: entry #6

im starting to doubt ill ever be able to actually do it. i dont have the balls. and what if i fuck it up? im afraid to take the chance. on the other hand, i wouldnt be able to live with the fact that i didnt ask...
Page 6: entry #7

im starting to think that maybe im not meant to be happy. i cant ask her again, theres just never a perfect time... i still love how her eyes shine, and how shes so full of energy. im ashamed i cant ask....
Page 7: entry #8

im ashamed of myself. im ashamed that i cant ask out nicola, im ashamed that im a wuss, im ashamed that i manage to fuck everything up. but theres nothing i can do about it. i feel helpless.
Page 8: entry#9

im not sure what to do anymore... i decided that the best place to hide  this would be right under nicolas house, because why would she check there? i think i seriously love her, it feels great...
Page 9: entry #10

i cant keep this up much longer. im under stress from all angles, and i wish that i could just fall asleep and not wake up. i know that people have it worse, but im getting tired of being here.
Page 10: entry #11

ti want it ot stop. the sleepless nights, the constant stress, all of it. ive cried myself to sleep more than i ever should. i cant take it anymore. its too much. i cant bring myself to do suicide.
Page 11: entry #12

i think ive been letting the stress get to me, and thats not good. its been really hard to think lately. im gonna stop this bullshit thats been going on lately and get back to business!
Page 12: entry #13

ive made it my absolute goal to ask nicola out before the end of the school year! now i just need to follow through on that...
Page 13: entry #14

i have officially lost all hope in this. the main reason i never acted depressed is because i had hope in this. now its gone. i guess im just not meant to be happy. i dont know how ill make it now.

Region! My first region/Village. I was breeding my mooshrooms I think
When I asked to be invited to another region Jakelay1999 invited me! so I went
Page 1
Page 3: To his region and asked me if i wanted to move in I said yes! He helped me move in and it was fun all the way!
I was thinking about my new home and loved it! It was small but awesome to have roomates! I then decided to make some chests. My bed was the 2
Page 4: Last Decoration. I was excited to begin! I still missed my old home.
I got used to it a few days later(MC days).
This were more serious then when I was moving in. No funnyness!Can You believe it! It was super boring I didnt even make my OWN room!
Page 3
Page 5: Things were really boring but things were about to get more intresting! 








Page 4
Page 6: Page 5-10
 
 Bored so bored! I made a porch(The worst mistake of MC days!). Then the next day It was GONE! It bugged jake so destroyed it! I moderated it and so
mumblerit(ADMIN) tryed to fix it, then my stuff was all gone! Page 5
Page 7: I couldnt believe it! I went to my room to scream as loud as I could! That didnt really happen though!
_
_
_
_
_
I dont feel any better though!
Page 6
Page 8: I thought my MC days were over! To have full diamond armor and diamond sword all my stuff was gone. So I left. It was to go to school though! : )!
When I came home I was quiet.
_
_
_
Page 7
Page 9: Then I said uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh But I was forgived! After my stuff had been gone! I was happy to here that! It had been my longest most adventurous journey! or so I thought! Me and my friends had mad room for a new comer! You will hear Page 8
Page 10: About him/her In the next pages! That was the strangest thing that ever happened to me! But again so I thought.






Page 9
Page 11: I was glad my friends forgave me but my stuff was gone!









Page 10
Page 12: Page 11-15

  I was missing my most prized possesion! Diamonds. I had to get them back! I asked jakelay1999 and he placed a diamond block and told me to mine it.
I had 9 diamonds! Magic_Winks was our newest member now!
Page 11
Page 13: He/she lives right next to my apartment room! I think jake wants an open doored house so im leaving my door open! I have been excited to get back on track after losing my stuff! Shadowdahedge lives in adifferent house across the street!
Page 12
Page 14: jakelay1999 dug a deep hole to prank shadowdahedge! I watched eating chips then I fell in the hole and died! I came back when jake said he would jump down with no armor and live! I knew he would die! I blocked down then waited then he jumped Page 13
Page 15: down and missed the water he placed and I used to get up! Then he died! I knew it! He came back then me and jake and shadowda kept beaking the block in front of shadowdas house. It was funny to me! However shadow wasnt having a good 

Page 14
Page 16: time for HE was on the other side!










Page 15
Page 17: Pages 16-20

  I was nervous but I regretted it. Me and my donkey went to Magic_winks house there was something fishy about that pit in his/hers house! I was gonna find out! I didnt find out but now I realize, He/she stole our donkeys! Page 16
Page 18: I couldnt believe what happened but it was true! It was unbelievable! I jumped on my donkey, then a CREPER blew up! It stunk, I then decided to quit with my donkey. AGAIN I am gonna go scream!

I am back! I am still mad! I thought I would never see my donkey again! A few days later (REAL days) I followed Magic. It lead to a building section! I was Page 18
Page 20: MAD! No one invited EARB2 THE AWESOME ONE ME! Imade my private space! I moved with only a few belongings! I was so mad no one likes my ideas! : (

   **By Machiavelli**
   **Brooke356**
Page 1: Chapter 1: 
Of Power and Which it is Acquired
~~
All servers are either republics or tyrannies. Republics are not to be dealt with. By strength or fortune, one can acquire a tyranny.
Page 2: Chapter 2:
Hereditary Principalities
~
It is easier to govern a hereditary than a new principality. The natural admin only has to keep these institutions intact and adapt to them.
Page 3: Chapter 3:
Of Attaining Power
~
In a principality, one attains power by either fortune or blood line. 
Page 4: Chapter 4:
Of Maintaining Power
~~
If an admin attains his power by choice of commoners, he has more difficulty maintaining it and must please the citizens that voted for him.

An admin governs his city-states. Republics are the hardest to govern. They must either be looted and disposed of or lived in to keep control.
Page 6: Chapter 6:
How the strength of all admins should be measured
~
Although an admin should maintain a strong army, he must also work on his defenses.
Page 7: Author's Note:
"The Admin" is an abriged version of the famous historical political handbook entitled "The Prince" by ancient Italian Niccolo Machiavelli. He writes on how to attain and maintain power, wage war, and govern city-states. In this version, 
Page 8: the author writes a handbook for powers of an admin; how to attain and maintain power, and how to 'govern' a server.

Long time no see! Literally. I was told you left along with NRH. I'm so sorry I disappeared for a while. Something came up and I just wasn't able to get on. I'm so sorry for leaving, but I came back and you all were gone. You, NRH, Z, and who 
Page 1: knows where Jake's been. I really hope we'll see each other again, even if it's just to say goodbye. This all sounds so sappy, I know :P But you are one of my best friends on here, and I have loved being friends with all of you for the past year. I've had
Page 2: some amazing memories, and I hope you do, too. If we don't see each other, well, good luck out there, man. You have a great personality and WILL go far in life. I hope to see you again, hopefully. Don't forget me, you loser :P

Love always,

Page 0: 
What is Laveyan satanism? 
Page 1: Neo (laveyan) satanism is also known as Athiestic satanism, its a selfish non thiestic religion that teaches social darwinism and egoism. Social darwinism is the idea that we apply the concept of natural selection to our society. "Only the strong survive"
Page 2: This idea is rejected by most rational people due to its total abandon of human nature. Our society makes it near impossible for natural selection to occur. 
Lavayan satanism has seven tenants or laws, as well as seven "sins" 
Page 3: Laveyan satanism also condones the practice of "magick". They believe that a man or womans willpower in thought can effect the physical world. They worship more the idea of a literary satan. Unlike thiestic satanism or "luciferianism" 
Page 4: There are multiple sects of modern satanism, the sect i am a member or is known as The Satanic Temple. We reject the ideas of social darwininism,Magick and egoism. We instead take a more humanistic approach. Our sect is based primarily in the united state
Page 5: We use our constitutional right to freedom of religion in order to oppose laws that threaten the seperation of church and state or are otherwise unreasonable. We are, in essence a psuedo religious organization who use legal technicalities to fight
Page 6: religious oppression.  The moral of this short pamphlet is....
Page 7: Satanists are not evil, we are not vile, we do not worship an evil diety and for FUCKS SAKES we do not sacrifice children. As a matter of fact the satanic temple has declared may 15th "Protect children day" Want to know more? visit www.thesatanictemple.

Yoshiki: Seems to be the best bet.
Page 22: *They were suprised when Seiko's Father opened the door*

Ayumi: Shouldn't you be ready for your wedding?
Seiko's Father: My wedding? Oh nooooo this is Seiko's wedding!

Page 23: *They all gasp to this information, Satoshi is the most suprised*

Page 25: *Satoshi is whispering into Ayumi ear*
Satoshi: I wonder how this will go...
Ayumi: Me too...
*Yoshiki butts into their conversation*
Yoshiki: Well seeing how Seiko is up there that means Naomi is the bride, correct?
Ayumi: It appears that way...
Page 26: *Music burst out and everyone rises as Naomi walks down the aisle*

Page 0: Dear Protectorate of the Red Banner,§0
§0
§0 We have noticed your admirable influence in this region, it is most remarkable.§0
§0
§0Herein this book, we wish to outline who we are, our influence in this borough and the detrimental effect this may have.
Page 1: We, the Brothers of the Citadel, reside deep beneath the Earth, within a strong, powerful haven. We strive to grow our power and become the leading power in the region.§0
§0 You, bearer of the Red Banner, coincide in our vicinity, thus potentially leading to
Page 2: our territories coalescing or contrasting, dependent on scenario.§0
§0
§0 The Citadel hereby declares a mutual peace treaty, upon which, the following wishes should be expected overleaf:
Page 3: - Your citizens should not aim to find or locate the citadel.§0
§0- We shall not attempt to excavate near your terrirtory.§0
§0
§0- We shall partner in endeavours within the Nether, for optimal mining capabilities.§0
§0...
Page 4: With the terms overleaf respected, the Citadel wishes you a well and prosperous growth in years to come.§0
§0
§0P.S. We have access to your Nether Portal and shall help grow and maintain your current outpost.d

	Title: Treatise Reply
	Author: Captain_Yaple
	Type: Written

Page 0: Brothers of The Citadel,§0
§0
§0Frostburne is always accepting of anyone who wishes to join. Part of what makes the residents unique is their willingness to endure in an otherwise inhospitable biome, a biome others would strive to avoid due to discomfort.
Page 1: We Frostburnians have always sought to rule this region of ice and snow with sheer will, our courage to survive where others would not. Our power grows not by the enchanted blades we weild, nor the armor we bear, but the courage in our hearts, the belief
Page 2: that drives us onward and through the terrors others wouldn't dare face.§0
§0
§0That being said, one accepts the need for compromise when it presents itself.§0
§0
§0Frostburne is focused on the harsh condition of the ice and snow above the ground,
Page 3: while I am driven to assume you dwell in your powerful haven beneath the earth. We strive to challenge ourselves, to live where others can't, to prove our mettle where it is most difficultly proven.  If it is indeed true that you dwell solely beneath the 
Page 4: earth, then there cannot be much room for conflict. The only circumstances which we excavate massive areas naturally would be in our twin mountains themselves, for the purpose of our own hidden areas.§0
§0
§0That's not to say one of ours wouldn't stumble upon
Page 5: your hidden citadel by accident. Such an issue is a chance occurrence, always possible of happening, but can hopefully be forgiven quite easily. The secrecy of your underground haven, if you so wish it, will be respected.§0
§0
§0(note: for the purposes of our
Page 6: alliance, I politely request, being protectorate of the region (akin to being a king), to at least know the location of said citadel, in order to nudge our building projects in another direction should they come near, thus preventing accidental discovery)
Page 7: Thus, in closing, as protectorate of the realm, I, Captain_Yaple, accept your proposition of a peace treaty between our two peoples. Our cultures seem vastly different at first, with you acting as hiders while we act as domestic Spartans. However, who's
Page 8: to say difference is to be paid any mind with time? §0
§0
§0The peace treaty we share, I wish to believe, will lend to something more. Perhaps an alliance, providing trust is established between our kingdoms, later on. Eventually, with such trust established,
Page 9: we can become greater than we are individually. A great man once had a dream of equality, but I have one of unity. I believe the people of Frostburne may rule their respective region of the cold, but not with an iron fist, not requiring to defend their 
Page 10: borders. A famous french general once invaded the wintry nation of Russia, only to fail in his entire campaign as a result. Our region has a natural defense, which quite possibly won't be needed in the far future. Wars come and go, and civilizations rise 
Page 11: and fall, but who says Frostburne cannot remain, nor your Brothers Of The Citadel? §0
§0
§0With this peace treaty, we can do more with the trust of our subjects, the trust of our citizens, the trust of all those within our kingdoms. You may be beneath us, but
Page 12:  you shall remain equals in our eyes.

P.S., I have privated the chest between the two of us so that we may ensure privacy in these diplomatic negotiations.

Page 0: P.P.S.§0
§0
§0If you're to make a hidden base, do attempt to make it somewhat hidden. A new house pops up randomly with naught but a railway line inside, and you're certain to be found out!
Page 1: My suggestion is to make a humble abode, like the one you have on the surface, but on the inside make it look like a normal house, with one block on the floor able to be removed for the sake of entrance to a railway line in the basement (say, for instance
Page 2: one cobblestone block that when removed, reveals a ladder).§0
§0
§0It would appear you have much to learn on the subject of hidden places. It is only I who have found it, unlike any of my own, so your citadel still remains a secret. Hopefully this will
Page 3: not impede our humble peace treaty.

Yours, Captain_Yaple, protectorate of Frostburne

Page 0: Dear Resident,§0
§0
§0Welcome to the Kingdom of Frostburne! We'll surely enjoy having you here, although there are a few rulings of public decency you must attend to before you will be granted citizenship, which will be found on the next page.
Page 1: 1. You must check in with either I, or my compatriot, Freckled_Penguin, and be granted rights to a plot of land, particularly the one you are already occupying.§0
§02. You must edit your construction to meet our specifications. Our land must maintain a
Page 2: generic theme of sorts, and your building of solid cobblestone just doesn't fit. If you don't have adequate building skills, we would be happy to help you out and teach you a few things.§0
§03. Put some signs on those chests, will you? This is for your sake, 
Page 3: not for ours. Also, if you do not have any chests claimed, you thus haven't claimed that plot of land either.§0
§0
§0Please speak to me or Freckled_Penguin for more information. We'd surely enjoy having you here, provided you follow these rules.
Page 4: Thank you, and have a nice day!§0

Of Power and Which it is Acquired
~~
All servers are either republics or tyrannies. Republics are not to be dealt with. By strength or fortune, one can acquire a tyranny.
Page 2: Chapter 2:
Hereditary Principalities
~
It is easier to govern a hereditary than a new principality. The natural admin only has to keep these institutions intact and adapt to them.
Page 3: Chapter 3:
Of Attaining Power
~
In a principality, one attains power by either fortune or blood line. 
Page 4: Chapter 4:
Of Maintaining Power
~~
If an admin attains his power by choice of commoners, he has more difficulty maintaining it and must please the citizens that voted for him. 
Page 5: Chapter 5:
Of City States
~
An admin governs his city-states. Republics are the hardest to govern. They must either be looted and disposed of or lived in to keep control.
Page 6: Chapter 6:
How the strength of all admins should be measured
~
Although an admin should maintain a strong army, he must also work on his defenses.
Page 7: Author's Note:
"The Admin" is an abriged version of the famous historical political handbook entitled "The Prince" by ancient Italian Niccolo Machiavelli. He writes on how to attain and maintain power, wage war, and govern city-states. In this version,

Page 2: approaching at a pace just slightly quicker than hers. As the car pulled up behind her she glanced and saw the turn signal on  the car was going to pass  when suddenly it swerved back behind her, pulled up dangerously close to her tailgate 
Page 3: and the brights flashed. Now she was getting nervous. The lights dimmed for a moment and then the brights came back on and the car behind her surged forward. The frightened woman struggled to keep her eyes on the road and fought 
Page 4: the urge to look at the car behind her. Finally, her exit approached but the car continued to follow, flashing the brights periodically. Through every stoplight and turn, it followed her until she pulled into her driveway.
Page 5: She figured her only hope was to make a mad dash into the house and call the §0police.As§0 she flew from the car, so did the driver of the car behind her  and he screamed, "Lock the door and call the police! Call 911!"
Page 6: When the police arrived the horrible truth was finally revealed to the woman. The man in the car had been trying to save her. As he pulled up behind her and his headlights illuminated her car, 
Page 7: he saw the silhouette of a man with a butcher knife rising up from the back seat to stab her,so he flashed his brights and the figure crouched back down. 
Page 8: The moral of the story: Always check the back seat! §0

Page 0: Don't ask me what I'm doing here, because I don't know. One day, I woke up in the middle of a forest, covered in snow, devoid of all memory and sense of identity. Why? I have no clue. It almost doesn't matter. I spent the first couple of hours calling for
Page 1: help, wandering around hoping I'd fine someone nearby. After a while, I came to the reluctant conclusion that I was well and truly isolated: no sounds of human voices, no hum of tires on distant roadways; nothing but the trill of far off birds and
Page 2: rustling branches in the wind. There might have been a cow nearby from all the mooing, but I couldn't find it.§0
§0I might not have know who I am, or why I woke up in this snowy forest, but that didn't mean I was going to sit down and let depression take me
Page 3: along with the wolves. I needed a plan of action, need to find a way to survive. But first, a man needs to know himself before he can trust himself, and because my old name was lost to my departed memory. I have decided to call myself Steve. Its a good 
Page 4: name.I spent some time searching the area, looking for anything that might be useful to me. Tools and weapons would be my first priority--don't ask me how I knew, but I could tell the forest would be dangerous at night, I don't know why. There
Page 5: wasn't much, not even a single fallen branch on the ground, just smooth snow and straight pine trees. i tried to grab hold of a few rocks peeking up from the soil,but they were firmly stuck. I'd need something to pry them free, or maybe break them away. I
Page 6: spotted a tree nearby and went to it, running my hands over the dark brown bark. It was a good tree.. strong and healthy.§0
§0
§0So I punched it.§0
§0
§0Pulp and bark flew as my hard fists broke chunk after chunk.
Page 7:  I gritted my teeth against the jarring in my arms and kept going until the whole thing broke through and crashed to the §0ground.Chest§0 heaving from the exertion, I gathered the wood and sat down, examining the pieces. I broke some of the longer chunks into
Page 8: thick sticks, then stabbed on of them into piece of wood shaped like a blade.§0
§0I grinned as I hefted the wooden axe I'd made, then swung it around experimentally. It felt good. I used the axe to fell several more tress until I had enough wood to make all
Page 9: the tools I needed: a shovel, sword and a pickaxe--the latter of which I used to break those stubborn stone from the ground. I stowed the rocks away for later use and strapped the tools to my back. I kept the sword out though, the feeling of danger in the
Page 10: woods tickling the back of my mind. Thus armed, I set off in search of food and shelter.I won't bore you with the details of my struggle against starvation and §0wolves.Suffice§0 it to say, it was a struggle. I fought, bled and conquered. I stumbled over
Page 11: hills and down into water-filled valleys, climbing trees to see the path ahead. I slew cows and ate their flesh to stay alive.I fell off cliffs and broke bones, spending days waiting for them to heal. I briefly marveled at how quickly the wounds mended,
Page 12: but wasted no time in pressing on once they did. At night times, I was attacked by monsters, proving my intuition about the forest to be correct. I hid from the darkness, lighting the small mud huts I'd built along the way with torches until the sim rose
Page 13: once again. I never knew why the world I'd woken up in was filled with skeletons and zombies, but it didn't really matter, I bashed their heads in with stone swords nonetheless. There were more questions to be had than answers, and I knew I would never
Page 14: know half of them.§0
§0
§0I had to SURVIVE!§0
§0
§0Weeks later, exhausted, clothes ripped and torn, blood from numerous cuts on my legs trailing into my socks, I finally found mountains. Majestic. I climbed them each, looking for the ideal spot to build a home
Page 15: far away from the oprressive trees and monster-filled shadows of the forest.I avoided the caves beneath those mountains, fearful of skeletons and massive spiders.I knew I would have to venture inside them eventually, but no then. I finally found a flat
Page 16: topped peak that overlooked the forests to the eats, and the ocean to the west. From its heights, I would be able to see the while land, and defend my homestead from intruders.§0
§0
§0It was good.
Page 17: That was a few months ago. I've since become used to this way of life, in this strange land. The name of Steve fits me like a glove, and I am the master of my modest stone home. I've raised cattle, planted wheat, and baked bread. I've explored those

§0=================== §0
§0An incredibly basic book for learning simple German phrases. §0

§0   Written by§6 Neskah§0.§0

§0
§3?§0: Ekip Publishings
Page 1: 
§0   §3§lINTRODUCTION§0
§0===================Welcome, reader! In this book, we will be discussing very basic German conversational skills. Please note: This book will §cNOT §0Fully teach you German.
Page 2: §3§l    NON-ENGLISH§0
§3§l      LETTERS§0
§0=================== If you're going to learn German, even basic phrases, there are 4 special characters you have to be aware of. 3 of them are what we call Umlaute. Umlaute are either an A, O, or U with 2 dots.
Page 3: §3ä§0: This character sounds very close to pronouncing the English letter A in the alphabet. (§aAYY§0), although it has less of a twang to it. Instead of pronouncing with a Y sound on the end, try saying "eh?"
Page 4: §3ü§0: With the U umlaut, things get more difficult. Try making an E sound, as in the word §6Me§0. While making this continued EE sound, curve your lips dramatically, like you're kissing someone or making an U sound. 
Page 5: §3ö§0: Like the U umlaut, combine the U sound with an English A. As in the word §6bay§0. While making this A sound, curve your lips, the sound produced should be a U umlaut.§0
§cPlease use Google for this part, it's very difficult to describe on-paper.
Page 6: §3ß§0: This is an Eszet. Make sure not to mistake it for a B, as it's pronounced nothing like it. The eszet is basically a short way to write a double s in German.§0
§0Example:§0
§6Füßen§0, a short way to write §6Füssen§0. §0
§0(§6Feet§0, in English.)
Page 7: A few other things to note about pronounciation of German letters:§0
§0===================§6W§0: Pronounced exactly like an English V.§0
§6V§0: Pronounced exactly like an English F.§0
§6J§0: Pronounced like an English Y. Example:§0
§0Ja = Yah.
Page 8: §6R§0: Google this one, too. It's pronounced very much like a French R, a gutteral sound from the back of your throat.§0
§6Z§0: Pronounced like an English TS. As in Pan§6ts§0. For example, Zehn (ten) is pronounced like Tsayn.
Page 9: Just like in English, groups of letters will make certain sounds together.§0
§6sch§0: Pronounced exactly like an English SH. Example: Tschüss!§0
§0would be pronounced like tshooss. (It's similar to saying Cheers! to a friend.)
Page 10: §6eu§0: Pronounced like an English -oy, as in the word b§6oy§0.§0
§6äu§0: Exactly like the EU, it is pronounced like -oy.§0
§6ie§0: Pronounced like an English ee, as in B§6ee§0.§0
§6ei§0: Pronounced like the English letter I, as in NEIN!
Page 11: §6-ch§0: The infamous flem, like you're coughing up a hairball. I'd recommend Googling this one, too.§0
§6-r§0: When an R comes at the end of a word, like a British accent, it is not pronounced. Example: Besser is pronounced like Bessah.
Page 12: §cth§0: This one is in red because it is NOT pronounced in German like in English. There is not a TH sound (like in the) in German. A TH together is simply pronounced like a T.
Page 13: Keep in mind that silent letters are almost nonexistant in German! Often you will find E's on the end of words, these are pronounced like (uh), like you're thinking about something. (uhhhh)§0
§0Example: Bitte is pronounced bit-tuh
Page 14: Now, on to what you came here for! Phrase-learning!§0

§0=================== §0
§0An incredibly basic book for learning simple German phrases. §0
§0
§0   Written by§6 Neskah§0.§0

§3?§0: Ekip Publishings
Page 1: 
§0   §3§lINTRODUCTION§0
§0===================Welcome, reader! In this book, we will be discussing very basic German conversational skills. Please note: This book will §cNOT §0Fully teach you German.
Page 2: §3§l    NON-ENGLISH§0
§3§l      LETTERS§0
§0=================== If you're going to learn German, even basic phrases, there are 4 special characters you have to be aware of. 3 of them are what we call Umlaute. Umlaute are either an A, O, or U with 2 dots.
Page 3: §3ä§0: This character sounds very close to pronouncing the English letter A in the alphabet. (§aAYY§0), although it has less of a twang to it. Instead of pronouncing with a Y sound on the end, try saying "eh?"
Page 4: §3ü§0: With the U umlaut, things get more difficult. Try making an E sound, as in the word §6Me§0. While making this continued EE sound, curve your lips dramatically, like you're kissing someone or making an U sound. 
Page 5: §3ö§0: Like the U umlaut, combine the U sound with an English A. As in the word §6bay§0. While making this A sound, curve your lips, the sound produced should be a U umlaut.§0
§cPlease use Google for this part, it's very difficult to describe on-paper.
Page 6: §3ß§0: This is an Eszet. Make sure not to mistake it for a B, as it's pronounced nothing like it. The eszet is basically a short way to write a double s in German.§0
§0Example:§0
§6Füßen§0, a short way to write §6Füssen§0. §0
§0(§6Feet§0, in English.)
Page 7: A few other things to note about pronounciation of German letters:§0
§0===================§6W§0: Pronounced exactly like an English V.§0
§6V§0: Pronounced exactly like an English F.§0
§6J§0: Pronounced like an English Y. Example:§0
§0Ja = Yah.
Page 8: §6R§0: Google this one, too. It's pronounced very much like a French R, a gutteral sound from the back of your throat.§0
§6Z§0: Pronounced like an English TS. As in Pan§6ts§0. For example, Zehn (ten) is pronounced like Tsayn.
Page 9: Just like in English, groups of letters will make certain sounds together.§0
§6sch§0: Pronounced exactly like an English SH. Example: Tschüss!§0
§0would be pronounced like tshooss. (It's similar to saying Cheers! to a friend.)
Page 10: §6eu§0: Pronounced like an English -oy, as in the word b§6oy§0.§0
§6äu§0: Exactly like the EU, it is pronounced like -oy.§0
§6ie§0: Pronounced like an English ee, as in B§6ee§0.§0
§6ei§0: Pronounced like the English letter I, as in NEIN!
Page 11: §6-ch§0: The infamous flem, like you're coughing up a hairball. I'd recommend Googling this one, too.§0
§6-r§0: When an R comes at the end of a word, like a British accent, it is not pronounced. Example: Besser is pronounced like Bessah.
Page 12: §cth§0: This one is in red because it is NOT pronounced in German like in English. There is not a TH sound (like in the) in German. A TH together is simply pronounced like a T.
Page 13: Keep in mind that silent letters are almost nonexistant in German! Often you will find E's on the end of words, these are pronounced like (uh), like you're thinking about something. (uhhhh)§0
§0Example: Bitte is pronounced bit-tuh
Page 14: Now, on to what you came here for! Phrase-learning!§0
